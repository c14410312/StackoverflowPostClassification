13225,8,"<p>I've recently inherited a internationalized and text-heavy Struts 1.1 web application. Many of the JSP files look like:</p>

<pre class=""lang-jsp prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;bean:message key=""alert"" /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and the properties files look like:</p>

<pre><code>messages.properties
alert=Please update your &lt;a href=""/address.do""&gt;address&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""/contact.do""&gt;contact information&lt;/a&gt;.
</code></pre>

<p>with the appropriate translations in N other languages (messages_fr.properties, etc).</p>

<p>Problems:</p>

<ol>
<li><em><strong>DRY violation</strong></em> - I have N references to my Struts action URLs instead of 1, which makes refactoring action URLs error-prone.</li>
<li><em><strong>Mixed concerns</strong></em> - My application's markup is now in more than just my JSP files, making it difficult for a web specialist to tweak the markup (using CSS, etc).</li>
<li><em><strong>Post-translation markup</strong></em> - Anytime I receive newly-translated text, I must decide what to surround with the <code>&lt;a&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;</code> markup. Easy for English but less so for unfamiliar languages.</li>
</ol>

<p>I've considered adding placeholders in the messages file, like:</p>

<pre><code>alert=Please update your {0} and {1}.
</code></pre>

<p>but then the words ""address"" and ""contact information"" would somehow need to be localized, wrapped with markup, and passed to my message tag - and I can't see an easy way to do it.</p>

It's possible that Hyperic may license SIGAR for commercial use, but I haven't looked into it. For my GPL projects, I will definitely consider SIGAR in the future.</p>

<p>For my current needs, I'm leaning towards the following:</p>

<li>For CPU usage, <code>OperatingSystemMXBean.getSystemLoadAverage() / OperatingSystemMXBean.getAvailableProcessors()</code> (load average per cpu)</li>

<li>For disk space, <code>File.getTotalSpace()</code> and <code>File.getUsableSpace()</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Limitations:</p>

<p>The <code>getSystemLoadAverage()</code> and disk space querying methods are only available under Java 6. Also, some JMX functionality may not be available to all platforms (i.e. it's been reported that <code>getSystemLoadAverage()</code> returns -1 on Windows).</p>

public class IntFoo implements Foo&lt;Integer&gt;

    {

}
</code></pre>

<p>This code will produce an error at <code>public</code><strong><code>int</code></strong><code>moo</code>, saying that <code>int</code> is incompatible with the overridden method's return type <code>Integer</code>. Strictly speaking, this is true, since <code>int</code> does not <em>directly</em> equal <code>Integer</code>. However, we all know that they can be implicitly converted to each other using auto(un)boxing. What is less know is the fact that the compiler generates a bridge method in this example:</p>

<pre><code>public class IntFoo implements Foo&lt;Integer&gt;
{
    public &lt;synthetic&gt; &lt;bridge&gt; Object moo()
    {
        return this.moo(); // upcast
    }

    public Integer moo() {
        return 0;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This has to be done because the JVM differentiates between return types when resolving methods, and since the erased return type of <code>Foo.moo</code> is <code>Object</code>, the compiler generated a bridge method with the same signature as the method.</p>

<p>I am wondering why this wouldn't work with primitive polymorphic return types as well:</p>

<pre><code>public class IntFoo implements Foo&lt;Integer&gt;
{
    public &lt;synthetic&gt; &lt;bridge&gt; Object moo()
    {
        return Integer.valueOf(this.moo());
    }

    public int moo()
    {
        return 0;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>There doesn't seem to be any reason not to have this feature:</p>

<pre><code>IntFoo intFoo = new IntFoo();
Foo&lt;Integer&gt; foo = intFoo;
Integer i = foo.moo(); // calls the synthetic method, which boxes the result of the actual implementation

1612939,32,"<p>Over the past year I've made huge improvements in my application's Java heap usage--a solid 66% reduction.  In pursuit of that, I've been monitoring various metrics, such as Java heap size, cpu, Java non-heap, etc. via SNMP.  </p>

<p>Recently, I've been monitoring how much real memory (RSS, resident set) by the JVM and am somewhat surprised.  The real memory consumed by the JVM seems totally independent of my applications heap size, non-heap, eden space, thread count, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Heap Size as measured by Java SNMP</strong>

<p><em>(The three dips in the heap graph correspond to application updates/restarts.)</em></p>

<p>This is a problem for me because all that extra memory the JVM is consuming is 'stealing' memory that could be used by the OS for file caching.  In fact, once the RSS value reaches ~2.5-3GB, I start to see slower response times and higher CPU utilization from my application, mostly do to IO wait.  As some point paging to the swap partition kicks in. This is all very undesirable.  </p>

<p><strong>So, my questions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Why is this happening?  What is going on <em>""under the hood""</em>?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What can I do to keep the JVM's real memory consumption in check?</strong></li>

<h1>The Problem &amp; Solution<em>s</em>:</h1>

<p>While in the end it was <strong><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/97799/atorras"">ATorras</a></strong>'s answer that proved ultimately correct, it <strong><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/42126/kdgregory"">kdgregory</a></strong> who guided me to the correct diagnostics path with the use of <code>pmap</code>.  (Go vote up both their answers!)  Here is what was happening:</p>

<p><strong><em>Things I know for sure:</em></strong></p>

<ol>
<li>My application records and displays data with <a href=""http://oldwww.jrobin.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JRobin 1.4</a>, something I coded into my app over three years ago.</li>
<li>The busiest instance of the application currently creates  

<ol>
<li>Over 1000 a few new JRobin database files (at about 1.3MB each) within an hour of starting up</li>
<li>~100+ each day after start-up</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The app updates these JRobin data base objects once every 15s, if there is something to write.</li>
<li>In the default configuration JRobin:

<ol>
<li>uses a <code>java.nio</code>-based file access back-end.  This back-end maps <code>MappedByteBuffers</code> to the files themselves.</li>
<li>once every five minutes a JRobin daemon thread calls <code>MappedByteBuffer.force()</code> on every JRobin underlying database MBB</li>
</ol></li>
<li><code>pmap</code> listed:

<ol>
<li>6500 mappings</li>
<li>5500 of which were 1.3MB JRobin database files, which works out to ~7.1GB</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>That last point was my <em>""Eureka!""</em> moment.</p>

<p><strong><em>My corrective actions:</em></strong></p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Consider updating to the latest JRobinLite 1.5.2 which is apparently better</li>
<li>Implement proper resource handling on JRobin databases.  At the moment, once my application creates a database and then never dumps it after the database is no longer actively used.</li>
<li>Experiment with moving the <code>MappedByteBuffer.force()</code> to database update events, and not a periodic timer.  Will the problem magically go away?</li>
<li><strong>Immediately</strong>, change the JRobin back-end to the java.io implementation--a line line change.  This will be slower, but it is possibly not an issue.  Here is a graph showing the immediate impact of this change.  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong><em>Questions that I may or may not have time to figure out:</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>What is going on inside the JVM with <code>MappedByteBuffer.force()</code>?   If nothing has changed, does it still write the entire file?  Part of the file?  Does it load it first?</li>
<li>Is there a certain amount of the MBB always in RSS at all times?  (RSS was roughly half the total allocated MBB sizes.  Coincidence?  I suspect not.)</li>
<li>If I move the <code>MappedByteBuffer.force()</code> to database update events, and not a periodic timer, will the problem magically go away?</li>
<li>Why was the RSS slope so regular?  It does not correlate to any of the application load metrics.</li>

I'm running a console app on my desktop right now while trying to get this to work. </p>

<p>Update 1: I noticed that my Axis2 directory has its own log4j.properties file in its root. Is this safely ignored or is it part of the solution (or part of the problem)?</p>

<pre><code>log4j.rootLogger=DEBUG, R

<p>Using <a href=""http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/"">jmh</a>, I wrote up a simple test (code and pom at end) which sees how many times the function can be run in 1 second.</p>

<p>The this is a 1300x factor between <code>testEqualsIntern</code> and <code>testEqualsNew</code> which is frankly <em>quite</em> surprising to me.</p>

I just have have significant difficulty believing that the additional code which appears to amount to walking over an array of size 1 for the two tests and comparing elements is <em>that</em> much of a performance hit.</p>

<p>I've also put in a test with another simple method call in the String to make sure I wasn't seeing something that is too crazy.</p>

<pre><code>for (Letter letter : Letter.values()) {
System.out.println(letter.getDescription());

<p>I thought that the values() method would give me an ordered view of the enum (as mentioned <a href=""http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-tiger04195/index.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>), but this is not the case here. I simply get the enum members in the order I created them within the Letter enum class. Is there a way to output the values of an enum in alphabetical order? Would I need a separate comparator object, or is there a built-in way to do this? Basically I would like the values to be alphabetically sorted based on the getDescription() text:</p>

Beta

<p>I've got a Spring Boot app that has an yaml properties file. Inside the properties file the structure looks something like this;</p>

<pre><code>optionA:
  foo:
    urls:
      - a
      - b
  bar:  
    something: hello

optionB:
  foo:
    urls:
      - x
      - y
  bar:  
    something: bye

<p>Both <code>optionA</code> and <code>optionB</code> have pretty much all the same properties, just different values.</p>

<p>So a request comes in, I check the request and decide if I need optionA or optionB.</p>

<p>I've been trying to get <code>@ConfigurationProperties</code> to handle this but the properties are initialised on startup so it can't be dynamic. Another possibility is that I have two Configuration classes, one for each option but then my code gets full of checks to switch between the two classes and the classes are pretty much identical, not really nice either. </p>

1749064,80,"<p>The obvious answer is to use <code>Charset.defaultCharset()</code> but we recently found out that this might not be the right answer. I was told that the result is different from real default charset used by java.io classes in several occasions. Looks like Java keeps 2 sets of default charset. Does anyone have any insights on this issue?</p>

<p>We were able to reproduce one fail case. It's kind of user error but it may still expose the root cause of all other problems. Here is the code,</p>

<pre><code>public class CharSetTest {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(""Default Charset="" + Charset.defaultCharset());
        System.setProperty(""file.encoding"", ""Latin-1"");
        System.out.println(""file.encoding="" + System.getProperty(""file.encoding""));
        System.out.println(""Default Charset="" + Charset.defaultCharset());
        System.out.println(""Default Charset in Use="" + getDefaultCharSet());
    }

    private static String getDefaultCharSet() {
        OutputStreamWriter writer = new OutputStreamWriter(new ByteArrayOutputStream());
        String enc = writer.getEncoding();
        return enc;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Our server requires default charset in Latin-1 to deal with some mixed encoding (ANSI/Latin-1/UTF-8) in a legacy protocol. So all our servers run with this JVM parameter,</p>

<pre><code>-Dfile.encoding=ISO-8859-1
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the result on Java 5,</p>

<pre><code>Default Charset=ISO-8859-1
file.encoding=Latin-1
Default Charset=UTF-8
Default Charset in Use=ISO8859_1
</code></pre>

<p>Someone tries to change the encoding runtime by setting the file.encoding in the code. We all know that doesn't work. However, this apparently throws off defaultCharset() but it doesn't affect the real default charset used by OutputStreamWriter.</p>

<p>Is this a bug or feature?</p>

<p>EDIT: The accepted answer shows the root cause of the issue. Basically, you can't trust defaultCharset() in Java 5, which is not the default encoding used by I/O classes. Looks like Java 6 corrects this issue.</p>

<p>I have the foxpro code, and I have successfully submitted the request via foxpro and received a valid response.  But I don't have any experience with Foxpro, so I have been struggling with the difference between the code in foxpro that works and the new code I'm writing in java.  </p>

<p>I am hoping that someone with more experience with Soap and web services can see my code, maybe try it themselves, and help me understand what the problem is.</p>

<p>I will provide the web service url as well as all my code.  I will also provide the foxpro command line code that works.  </p>

<p>The foxpro code uses <code>CreateObject(""Microsoft.XMLHTTP"")</code>.  I have learned through my research that this is also used in ASP, VB.net and C#.  </p>

<p>1) Here is the web service that I need to call:</p>

<p>Host: <code>https://rlisapi.myfwc.com/</code></p>

<p>Soap Endpoint: <code>https://rlisapi.myfwc.com/wsReceipts.asmx</code></p>

<p>WSDL: <code>https://rlisapi.myfwc.com/wsReceipts.asmx?WSDL</code></p>

<p>This web service doesn't contain ws-security.  The credentials are in the request itself.  I can't provide those, of course, but I don't believe they are needed to help me solve the connection reset problem.</p>

<p>Finally, in addition to all these test clients, I also tried submitting various requests using SOAP UI.  Interestingly, I couldn't load the wsdl from the url so I saved the wsdl source code to a local file and used it.</p>

<p>Here is the request generated by Soap UI from the wsdl file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;soap:Envelope xmlns:soap=""http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope"" xmlns:rlis=""http://api.outdoorlicensesolution.com/RLIS/""&gt;

         &lt;rlis:AgentID&gt;?&lt;/rlis:AgentID&gt;

<p>From all my research over the last couple of days, what I've determined is that this error is most often caused by the server closing the connection prior the client being done reading it.  </p>

<p>At first I thought there was something wrong with the web service itself, but since I'm able to run the foxpro command and get a valid response, that can't be the case.  </p>

<p>I tried changing many of the preferences in Soap UI settings too, including the socket timeout.  </p>

<p>Also, my requests do not go through a proxy server.</p>

<p>Any suggestions or advice will be greatly appreciated!

<p>Then the series of messages repeats.</p>

<p>So I think what this is showing is that there was first a connection request made from the client ,which was acknowledged by the server.
Then there was a Client Hello, a Server Hello, Handshake Protocol Certificate, Server Hello Done, Client Key Exchange, Change Cipher Spec, Encrypted Handshake Message and then finally the Connection Reset (RST) from the server.</p>

<p>I looked up what the Expert Info on the last frame means, and it looks like it could mean protocol sequence suspicious, e.g. sequence wasn't continuous or a retransmission was detected...</p>

<p>This still has me scratching my head!  I don't understand what I may be doing in my code, or from Soap UI that could cause this connection reset from the server.  And why it doesn't happen from the Microsoft.XMLHTTP post in foxpro code...  Could it be that my request is getting sent as fragments and the server won't accept that?  </p>

<p>I think I am going to try to run a wireshark capture while running the foxpro command, but that is on a PC with Windows 8, so I need to first figure out how to run it under admin.  The java test client I'm running that gets a connection reset is on my mac.</p>

1863479,8,"<p>I have the code of a simple game, where an AgentInterface must be implemented in order to create an agent controller for one of the characters in the game. GameState is a class the implements GameStateInterface, and an object that implements this interface can be passed to the agent, so the agent can read and analyze the data from game state, and the agent must return the appropriate action (returned as an int) that the character should take.</p>

<p>This is the AgentInterface that agents must implement:</p>

<pre><code>public interface AgentInterface {
    // the return value specifies the direction of the joystick
    public int action(GameStateInterface gs);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Running the game with an agent called MyAgent:</p>

<pre><code>    GameState gs = new GameState();
    AgentInterface agent = new MyAgent();
    while (true) {
        // more code here
        int bestAction = agent.action(gs)
        // more code here
    }        
</code></pre>

<p>But, there is some information in GameState that the agent should NOT be able to access, since that would be cheating for the controller. But, doing a cast conversion from GameStateInterface to GameState would allow the agent to access information that is not defined in the GameStateInterface, like this:</p>

<pre><code>public MyAgent implements AgentInterface {
    public int action(GameStateInterface gs) {
        int nLives = ((GameState) gs).nLivesRemaining; // IS IT POSSIBLE TO DENY/PREVENT THIS CAST??
        // Do more stuff here
        return BestAction;
    }
}

<p>My question would be, is it possible to block a cast conversion? I know polymorphism is one of the main features of Java and Object-Oriented Programming Languages, but in cases like this I would like to avoid cast conversions.</p>

<p>I know this can be solved in many other ways, but I was curious to know if it is possible to do this.</p>

<p>So I read that often memory leaks within Swing applications originate from the use of various listeners (mouse, key, focus, etc). Essentially, because you register an object as a listener and forget to deregister the object, the notifier ends up holding onto the reference of the object, and leaks a bit of memory.</p>

<p>I knew our application wasn't deregistering listeners and did a bit of research on potential solutions:</p>

<p>I found one approach in dealing with the problem was the use of a WeakReference, full details on the approach with swing listeners can be found <a href=""http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t19468.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>I then became curious about how the <a href=""http://netbeans.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NetBeans</a> form editor was generating code to clean up after listeners added to the form and discovered that NetBeans was registering listeners via a wrapping object i.e.</p>

<pre><code>argTypeComboBox.addItemListener(new java.awt.event.ItemListener() {
    public void itemStateChanged(java.awt.event.ItemEvent evt) {
      argTypeComboBoxItemStateChanged(evt);
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>But the generated code did not seem to ever clean up by calling <code>removeItemListener</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<p>Is the wrapping object acting like a weak reference? To me it looks like it could leak a tiny amount of memory (the size of the wrapping object)?</p>

<p>I have written another version of the knapsack that uses brute force. This version has very little synchronization because I only need to update a bestSoFar variable at the end of a single thread's execution. Therefore, each thread pretty much should execute completely in parallel except for that small critical section at the end.</p>

<p>I ran this versus the sequential brute force and still it takes longer. I don't see any other explanation than that my threads are being run sequentially, either because they are being mapped to the same core or to the same native thread.</p>

17531625,43,"<p>I'm working on a Java project in Eclipse, which is built using Maven. I'm using some recycled code from an older project, and one of these classes looks for a file in the ""META-INF/services"" folder of the JAR with a particular name, then parses the text of this file. In this particular example, it looks for a file with the name of a Java interface, then grabs the class name of the implementation from inside the file.</p>

<p>So basically what I'm trying to do is <strong>include a file in the ""META-INF/services"" folder of the JAR with a file name (X), and one line of text (Y)</strong>. I'm guessing this should be done using Maven, maybe by specifying an attribute in the POM file, but my research hasn't turned up anything. I know you're not supposed to hard-code or manually type out any META files, so I'm not sure what to do here.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>
I sent a message to Verifinger team and they sent me this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Trial SDK package includes all the functionality, including VeriFinger Extended.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before starting to implement these questions should be raised and answered:</p>

<ul>
<li>Will your solution be able to interact with user's computer?</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want your browser application to use client side fingerprint scanners and you want to use Neurotechnology components for it - you should write an applet (Java) or ActiveX component and then embed it to C# asp.net application (sorry we do not have sample for that). There are other ways of implementation but the applet is a general approach.</p>

<ul>
<li>Will your solution be able to extract biometric templates on client side?</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want your application to extract and/or do matching on client pc - you will have to use either an applet or ActiveX (in order to run code that references our libraries on clients pc). If you do not want to do that - you can capture an image (either with our components, or maybe just allowing client to select a file), upload it to the back-end (running C# ASP.NET, Java EE or even PHP), do processing there, return the results.</p>

<p>In general the Java Applet sample is a good place to start: you can use it for image capture and/or template extraction and write your own middleware (like enrollment to database or matching) on server (i.e. web services) and reference it from the client browser application.</p>

<p>SDK does include Abis sample java applet. It can be built with Maven running from command prompt this command: ""mvn clean install -Papplet""</p>

<p>From SDK\samples\biometrics\java directory (if SDK 5.0 is used)</p>

<p>From SDK\samples\ (if SDK 4.5 is used)</p>

<p>How does JVM ensure thread safety of memory allocations on heap?</p>

<p>Heap is one for all threads and it has its own internal data.</p>

<p>For simplicity assume a simple compacting garbage collector implementation, -XX:+UseSerialGC
-XX:+UseParallelGC, with simple incremental pointer to mark a start of free space and one continuous free space in Eden (heap).</p>

<p>There must be some kind of synchronization between threads when heap space is allocated for <em>Cat</em>, <em>Dog</em> and <em>Mouse</em> instances otherwise they can easily end up overwriting each other. Does that mean that every <strong>new</strong> operator hides inside some synchronized blocks? This way, many ""lock free"" algorithms are not in fact completely lock free ;)</p>

<p>I assume that memory allocations are made by the application thread themselves, synchronously, not by another dedicated thread(s).</p>

<p>I am aware of <a href=""https://blogs.oracle.com/jonthecollector/entry/the_real_thing"" rel=""noreferrer"">TLAB</a>s, or Thread Local Allocation Buffer. They allow threads to have a separate memory areas in Eden for allocations, so no synchronization is required. But I am not sure if TLAB is set by default, it is somewhat very obscure HotSpot feature. Note: do not confuse TLAB and <code>ThreadLocal</code> variables!</p>

<p>I also assume, that with more complex garbage collectors, like G1, or non-compacting garbage collectors, more complex heap structure data has to be maintained, like list of free blocks for CMS, so more synchronization is needed.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Please let me clarify this. I accept answer for HotSpot JVM implementation and variants with and without active TLAB.</p>

<p>It looks like the syntax of the java command is not correct as the classpath is not properly added to the java programm. My main problem now is the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>MacOS is not officially supported by Sun/Oracle that's why it's difficult to find some good documentation. (I need the latest JRE 7).</li>
<li>I never used any Mac or don't have any to try out how it could work.</li>
</ol>

<p>So my questions are now:</p>

<ol>
<li>How to run java from command line in MacOS, what's the correct syntax? Or why does the command above not work? (For example the main difference between Windows and Linux is using semicolon <code>;</code> instead of colon <code>:</code> separator for the classpath.)</li>
<li>How should a MacOS script file should be named? <code>.sh</code> or <code>.scpt</code> or  <code>.command</code> or is it like in linux that the file ending doesn't matter as long as you <code>chmod +x</code> the script file?</li>

Tableswitch should work fast so doesn't bring a lot of extra work. But anyway, what is the purpose of generating additional switch?<br>
<strong>Update</strong><br>
I understand possibility of hashCode collisions. What I'm trying to say is that instead of subsequent tableswitch, compiler could move all the real work from subsequent tableswitch to first and then use ifeq to jump to the end of all switch branches. <em>So the one possible answer I see here: that in first switch compiler tries to precompute label for ifeq jump based on known number of cases, but I'm not sure that it is the only reason.</em><br><br>

My understanding is that JMH forks the JVM multiple times during benchmarking in order to discard any profiles built up by the just-in-time (JIT) profiling performed by the JVM during execution.</p>

<p>I understand why this is useful in some cases such as the below (copied verbatim from <a href=""http://java-performance.info/jmh/"">http://java-performance.info/jmh/</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By default JHM forks a new java process for each trial (set of iterations). This is required to defend the test from previously collected “profiles” – information about other loaded classes and their execution information. For example, if you have 2 classes implementing the same interface and test the performance of both of them, then the first implementation (in order of testing) is likely to be faster than the second one (in the same JVM), because JIT replaces direct method calls to the first implementation with interface method calls after discovering the second implementation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, in the case where you are benchmarking the same code repeatedly is there any advantage to running say 10 forks of 20 iterations each instead of 1 fork with 200 iterations?</p>

(Normal, adequately-permissioned client interactions with the STOMP endpoint and topics work just as expected.)</p>

<p>I have tried subscribing to <code>users/{subscribingUsername}/queue/errors</code> and just plain <code>users/queue/errors</code> with my Java test client after it is successfully connected, but I have thus far been unable to get sort of error message about the subscription exception from the server delivered to the client.

    static int obtainNumber() { return -1; }

<p>So I figured maybe Java will just use the first one it sees. I reordered to test:</p>

    static int obtainNumber() { return -1; }
    static int obtainNumber() { return 42; }
    static {

    static int obtainNumber() { return 1; }
    static int obtainNumber() { return 2; }

<p>After reading the line and getting the Arabic and Chinese word I use a function to translate them by simply searching for <em>Given Arabic Text</em> in an ArrayList (which contain all expected words) (using indexOf(); method). Then when the word's index is found it's used to call the English word which has the same index in another Arraylist. However this search always returns false because it fails when searching the question marks instead of the Arabic and Chinese characters. So my System.out.println print shows me nulls, one for each failure to translate.</p>

<p>The script works very well, but in essence it is all configured through half a dozen maps holding project and environment information.</p>

<p>I want to abstract the tasks away into another file, so that I can simply define my maps in a simple build file, and import the tasks from the other file. In this way, I can use the same core tasks for a number of projects and configure those projects with a simple set of maps.</p>

<p>Can anyone tell me how I can import one gradle file into another, in a similar manner to Ant's  task? I've trawled Gradle's docs to no avail so far.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Info</strong></p>

<p>After Tom's response below, I thought I'd try and clarify exactly what I mean.</p>

<p>Basically I have a gradle script which runs a number of subprojects. However, the subprojects are all Netbeans projects, and come with their own ant build scripts, so I have tasks in gradle to call each of these.</p>

<p>My problem is that I have some configuration at the top of the file, such as:</p>

<pre><code>projects = [
    [name:""MySubproject1"", shortname: ""sub1"", env:""mainEnv"", cvs_module=""mod1""],
    [name:""MySubproject2"", shortname: ""sub2"", env:""altEnv"", cvs_module=""mod2""]
]
</code></pre>

<p>I then generate tasks such as:</p>

<pre><code>projects.each({
    task ""checkout_$it.shortname"" &lt;&lt; {
         // Code to for example check module out from cvs using config from 'it'.
    }
})
</code></pre>

<p>I have many of these sort of task generation snippets, and all of them are generic - they entirely depend on the config in the projects list.</p>

<p>So what I want is a way to put this in a separate script and import it in the following sort of way:</p>

<pre><code>projects = [
    [name:""MySubproject1"", shortname: ""sub1"", env:""mainEnv"", cvs_module=""mod1""],
    [name:""MySubproject2"", shortname: ""sub2"", env:""altEnv"", cvs_module=""mod2""]
]

import(""tasks.gradle"") // This will import and run the script so that all tasks are generated for the projects given above.
</code></pre>

<p>So in this example, tasks.gradle will have all the generic task generation code in, and will get run for the projects defined in the main build.gradle file. In this way, tasks.gradle is a file that can be used by all large projects that consist of a number of sub-projects with Netbeans ant build files.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Do you see any issues?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Can you provide a better solution?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Are there any existing libraries to help with this?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>This is a common question on SO and elsewhere, but the only answer I've seen is to always use PreparedStatements. Fwiw, I'm using JasperReports. I want to keep the query inside of JasperReports. The built-in Jasper parameter functions for query parameter handling (including the X{} functions) are not sufficient for what I need to parametrize. I could try creating a custom Jasper QueryExecutor that would allow me to inject my own X{} functions, but that's more complicated than just generating a dynamic SQL where clause with Jasper's $P!{} syntax.</p></li>
<li><p>I looked at the <a href=""https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page"" rel=""noreferrer"">OWASP libraries</a>. They do not have a PostgresSQL codec yet. I looked at the <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/owasp-esapi-java/source/browse/trunk/src/main/java/org/owasp/esapi/codecs/OracleCodec.java"" rel=""noreferrer"">OracleCodec</a> though and its escaping seemed simplistic. I'm not sure it would be of much helping preventing SQL injection attacks.</p></li>
<li><p>In my code I'm adding the E so as to not be dependent on PostgreSQL's standard_conforming_strings setting.  Ideally I wouldn't have to add that and then the function wouldn't have to be PostgreSQL specific. More info: <a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/static/sql-syntax-lexical.html#SQL-SYNTAX-STRINGS-ESCAPE"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/static/sql-syntax-lexical.html#SQL-SYNTAX-STRINGS-ESCAPE</a> .</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally I would've liked a more generic and robust solution that I knew would be safe and support all possible UTF-8 strings.</p>

<p>The Eclipse JUnit plugin has a wizard to create a test suite, but for some reason it doesn't ""see"" my test classes. It may be looking for JUnit 3 tests, not JUnit 4 annotated tests.</p>

<p>I could write a tool that would automatically create the suite by scanning the source files.</p>

<p>Or I could write code so the application would scan it's own jar file for tests (either by naming convention or by looking for the @Test annotation).</p>

<p>It seems like there should be an easier way. What am I missing?</p>

In addition, no one seemed to dare to upvote, nor downvote my answer.</p>

<p>I was told there that it's bad practice, but then I was also told that garbage collector runs don't systematically stop the world anymore, and that it could also effectively be used by the JVM only as a hint, so I'm kind of at loss.</p>

<p>I do understand that the JVM usually knows better than you when it needs to reclaim memory. I also understand that worrying about a few kilobytes of data is silly. I also understand that even megabytes of data isn't what it was a few years back. But still, 1.5 gigabytes? And you <em>know</em> there's like 1.5 GB of data hanging around in memory; it's not like it's a shot in the dark. Is <code>System.gc()</code> systematically bad, or is there some point at which it becomes okay?</p>

<p>So the question is actually double:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why is or isn't it bad practice to call <code>System.gc()</code>? Is it really merely a hint to the JVM under certain implementations, or is it always a full collection cycle? Are there really garbage collector implementations that can do their work without stopping the world? Please shed some light over the various assertions people have made in the comments to my <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/2406360/3650944"">answer</a>.</li>
<li>Where's the threshold? Is it <em>never</em> a good idea to call <code>System.gc()</code>, or are there times when it's acceptable? If so, what are those times?</li>

2428725,9,"<p>This is a problem I encounter frequently in working with more complex systems and which I have never figured out a good way to solve.  It usually involves variations on the theme of a shared object whose construction and initialization are necessarily two distinct steps.  This is generally because of architectural requirements, similar to applets, so answers that suggest I consolidate construction and initialization are not useful. The systems have to target Java 4 at the latest, so answers that suggest support available only in later JVMs are not useful either.</p>

<p>By way of example, let's say I have a class that is structured to fit into an application framework like so:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClass
{

private /*ideally-final*/ SomeObject someObject;

MyClass() {
    someObject=null;
    }

public void startup() {
    someObject=new SomeObject(...arguments from environment which are not available until startup is called...);
    }

public void shutdown() {
    someObject=null; // this is not necessary, I am just expressing the intended scope of someObject explicitly
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I can't make someObject final since it can't be set until startup() is invoked.  But I would really like it to reflect its write-once semantics and be able to directly access it from multiple threads, preferably avoiding synchronization.</p>

<p>The idea being to express and enforce a degree of finalness, I conjecture that I could create a generic container, like so (<strong>UPDATE - corrected threading sematics of this class</strong>):</p>

<pre><code>public class WormRef&lt;T&gt;
{
private volatile T                      reference;                              // wrapped reference

public WormRef() {
    reference=null;
    }

public WormRef&lt;T&gt; init(T val) {
    if(reference!=null) { throw new IllegalStateException(""The WormRef container is already initialized""); }
    reference=val;
    return this;
    }

public T get() {
    if(reference==null) { throw new IllegalStateException(""The WormRef container is not initialized""); }
    return reference;
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>and then in <code>MyClass</code>, above, do:</p>

<pre><code>private final WormRef&lt;SomeObject&gt; someObject;

MyClass() {
    someObject=new WormRef&lt;SomeObject&gt;();
    }

public void startup() {
    someObject.init(new SomeObject(...));
    }

public void sometimeLater() {
    someObject.get().doSomething();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Which raises some questions for me:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is there a better way, or existing Java object (would have to be available in Java 4)?</li>
</ol>

<p>Secondarily, in terms of thread safety:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is this thread-safe <strong><em>provided</em></strong> that no other thread accesses <code>someObject.get()</code> until after its <code>set()</code> has been called.  The other threads will only invoke methods on MyClass between startup() and shutdown() - the framework guarantees this.</li>
<li>Given the completely unsynchronized <code>WormReference</code> container, it is ever possible under either JMM to see a value of <code>object</code> which is neither null nor a reference to a SomeObject?  In other words, does the JMM always guarantee that no thread can observe the memory of an object to be whatever values happened to be on the heap when the object was allocated.  I believe the answer is ""Yes"" because allocation explicitly zeroes the allocated memory - but can CPU caching result in something else being observed at a given memory location?</li>
<li>Is it sufficient to make WormRef.reference volatile to ensure proper multithreaded semantics?</li>
</ol>

<p>Note the primary thrust of this question is how to <strong>express and enforce the finalness</strong> of <code>someObject</code> without being able to actually mark it <code>final</code>; secondary is what is necessary for thread-safety.  That is, don't get too hung up on the thread-safety aspect of this.</p>

<p>I want to implement a network protocol in Java (but this is a rather general question, I faced the same issues in C++), this is not the first time, as I have done this before. But I think I am missing a good way to implement it. In fact usually it's all about exchanging text messages and some byte buffers between hosts, storing the status and wait until the next message comes. The problem is that I usually end up with a bunch of switch and more or less complex if statements that react to different statuses / messages. The whole thing usually gets complicated and hard to mantain. Not to mention that sometimes what comes out has some ""blind spot"", I mean statuses of the protocol that have not been covered and that behave in a unpredictable way. I tried to write down some state machine classes, that take care of checking start and end statuses for each action in more or less smart ways. This makes programming the protocol very complicated as I have to write lines and lines of code to cover every possible situation. 
What I'd like is something like a good pattern, or a best practice that is used in programming complex protocols, easy to mantain and to extend and very readable. </p>

The app is a frontend to a mainframe system which handles the CC numbers internally and - as we have just found out - occasionally still spits out a full CC number on one of its response screens. By default, the whole content of these responses are logged at debug level, and also the content parsed from these can be logged in lots of different places. So I can't hunt down the source of such data leaks. I must make sure that CC numbers are masked in our log files.</p>

<p>Thanks to Cletus for a most authoritative answer, but I'm still wondering why, if you can already view a <code>Map&lt;K,V&gt;</code> as <code>Set&lt;Map.Entries&lt;K,V&gt;&gt;</code> (via <code>entrySet()</code>), it doesn't just extend that interface instead.</p>

9795677,16,"<p>I think this is a fairly common question: how to put my business logic in a global transaction in distributed systems environment? Cite an example, I have a TaskA containing couples of sub tasks:</p>

<p>TaskA {subtask1, subtask2, subtask3 ... }</p>

<p>each of these subtasks may execute on local machine or a remote one, I hope TaskA executes in an atomic manner(success or fail) by means of transaction. Every subtask has a rollback function, once TaskA thinks the operation fails(because one of subtask fails), it calls each rollback function of subtasks. Otherwise TaskA commits the whole transaction.</p>

<p>To do this, I follow ""Audit trial"" transaction pattern to have a record for each subtask, so TaskA can know operation results of subtasks then decide rollback or commit. This sounds like simple, however, the hard part is how to associate each subtask to the global transaction?</p>

<p>When TaskA begins, it starts a global transaction about which subtask knows nothing. To make subtask aware of it, I have to pass the transaction context to every invocation of subtask. This is really dreadful! My subtask  may either execute in a new thread or execute in remote by sending a message through AMQP broker, it's hard to consolidate the way of context propagation. </p>

<p>I did some research like ""Transaction Patterns - A Collection of Four Transaction Related Patterns"", ""Checked Transactions in an Asynchronous Message Passing Environment"", none of these solve my problem. They either don't have practical example or don't solve the context propagation issue. </p>

<p>I wonder how people solve this? as this sort of transaction must be common in enterprise software.</p>

<p>Is X/Open XA only the solution for this? Can JTA help here(I have't look into JTA as most stuff for it relate to database transaction, and I am using Spring, I don't want to involve another Java EE application server in my software).</p>

<p>Can some expert share some thoughts with me? thank you.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p><strong>Arjan and Martin gave out really good answers, thank you.
Finally I didn't go with this way.</strong> After more research, I chose another pattern ""<strong>CheckPoint</strong>"" <a href=""http://ncomprod.nokia.com/library/files/docs/Design_Patterns_for_Checkpoint-Based_Rollback_Recovery.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"" title=""Check Point"">1</a>.</p>

<p>Looking into my requirement, I found my intention to ""Audit Trial Transaction Pattern"" is to know which level the operation has proceeded to, if it's failed, I can restart it at the failed spot after reloading some context. Actually this is not transaction, it didn't rollback other successful steps after failure. This is essence of CheckPoint pattern.
However, studying distributed transaction stuff makes me learned lot of interesting things. Apart from what Arjan and Martin have mentioned. I also suggest people digging into this area take a look at CORBA which is a well-known protocol for distributed system.</p>

  <p>(One reason for requiring inlining of constants is that switch statements require constants on each case, and no two such constant values may be the same.

Also there are some other objects that are constructed using <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Google Guice</a> and need to be injected with references to some objects from previously described object hierarchy. How do I do such kind of injection with Guice?</p>

<p>The problem is that objects from existing hierarchy were not constructed using Guice, and therefore are not subject to inject process by default. There is, of course <code>injector.injectMembers()</code> method that is able to inject into existing object instance, but it does not work on object hierarchies.</p>

<p>For those wondering why I can't build mentioned object hierarchy using Guice. This hierarchy represents GUI objects and is built by a GUI framework (<a href=""http://pivot.apache.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Apache Pivot</a>) from a declarative GUI description (in fact this process can be described as object deserialization). That way interface construction is rather simple, and I only want to inject certain service references into interface objects and vice versa (for callbacks).</p>

<p>Approach I am currently about to take is described below. </p>

<p>For injecting into preexisting object hierarchy just let all objects that are interested in injection implement certain interface, like:</p>

<pre><code>public interface Injectable {
  void injectAll(Injector injector);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Those objects would then implement this interface like so:</p>

<pre><code>public void injectAll(Injector injector) {
  injector.injectMembers(this);
  for (Injectable child : children)
    child.injectAll(injector);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then I'd just call <code>mainWindow.injectAll(injector)</code> for root object in hierarchy and all objects of interest are injected.</p>

<p>Not very nice solution, but gets the work done on one side. On the other side, I need to inject objects from this hierarchy. I guess it can be done via implementing custom provider for such objects.</p>

  <p>A third common source of memory leaks

  you implement an API where clients
  register callbacks but don’t
  deregister them explicitly, they will
  accumulate unless you take some
  action. The best way to ensure that
  callbacks are garbage collected
  promptly is to store only weak

<blockquote>
  <p>All soft references to softly-reachable objects are guaranteed to have
  been cleared before the virtual machine throws an OutOfMemoryError.
  Otherwise no constraints are placed upon the time at which a soft
  reference will be cleared or the order in which a set of such
  references to different objects will be cleared. Virtual machine
  implementations are, however, encouraged to bias against clearing
  recently-created or recently-used soft references.</p>
  
  <p>Direct instances of this class may be used to implement simple caches;
  this class or derived subclasses may also be used in larger data
  structures to implement more sophisticated caches. As long as the
  referent of a soft reference is strongly reachable, that is, is
  actually in use, the soft reference will not be cleared. Thus a
  sophisticated cache can, for example, prevent its most recently used
  entries from being discarded by keeping strong referents to those
  entries, leaving the remaining entries to be discarded at the
  discretion of the garbage collector.</p>

The best thing would be to be able to annotate generic stuff such as column names (since the will be identical) in the super class but that does not work because JPA annotations are not inherited by child classes. Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class MyAbstractEntity {

  @Column(name=""PROPERTY"") //This will not be inherited and is therefore useless here
  protected String property;


  public String getProperty() {
    return this.property;
  }

  //setters, hashCode, equals etc. methods
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which I would like to inherit and only specify the child-specific stuff, like annotations:</p>

<pre><code>@Entity
@Table(name=""MY_ENTITY_TABLE"")
public class MyEntity extends MyAbstractEntity {

  //This will not work since this field does not override the super class field, thus the setters and getters break.
  @Column(name=""PROPERTY"") 
  protected String property;

}
</code></pre>

<p>Any ideas or will I have to create fields, getters and setters in the child classes?</p>

<p><strong>Scenario:</strong></p>

<p>Let's say my team is working on a software project, a Fany-WordPad like application which has a feature called <strong>Fancy-Word-Art</strong> ( just like MS Office's word Art). Now I wrote the code for the main window( using WPF in .Net, or using Window Builder in Java, doesn't matter which tool/language). </p>

<p>Now if my colleague Mr Spongebob is writing the Word-Art part, how would I <strong>tell him</strong> what functions to call / Api to use to draw on my window? i.e. How do I let Mr SpongeBob know that he needs to call GetWindow() method to get a reference to the drawing surface, the parameters he needs to pass along , and so on?</p>

<p>I hope I am being clear here. Is this the procedure?</p>

<p><strong>Step 1 :</strong> Use your company wiki site to understand your colleague's written code</p>

<p><strong>Step 2 :</strong> Write the <code>GetWindow()</code> method so that it works well with the rest of the project</p>

<p><strong>Step 2 :</strong> Now put a wiki on your intranet with the method parameters/ data type requirement  for your <code>GetWindow()</code> method  or use Doxygen/ Confluence  as suggested below</p>

<p><strong>Step 3 :</strong> Now its your colleague Mr Spongebob's headache how to find how to draw his word-art on my window.</p>

<p>This just doesnt sound right .. With tons of functions, Spongebob's life will be hard, just as mine. Both of us rummaging through documentation to find the right functions to do our job. What if then I change <code>GetWindow() to GetWindow(string title)</code>.. Now how do I <code>literally tell</code> the poor spongebob he needs to redo his code.</p>

<p>Am I missing something here? Please share your experience, how do you tackle this problem in a real world software house environment? If your fellow developer is on the next table , do you actually <strong>show</strong> them how to implement a certain method as they get stuck, or how do you deal with this situation?

9426957,8,"<p>I am having some problems getting Eclipse to honour a test-scoped Maven dependency - it is showing up on the build path and messing with eclipse's compilation / javadoc resolution.</p>

<h3>An example with Java EE libs</h3>

<p>I have been using the <code>javaee-api-6.0</code> library to compile my Java EE application against. </p>

<p>However, for unit testing purposes, I wanted to have access to more than just the api - I needed an implementation. So I included the embedded glassfish libs with a test scope like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;repositories&gt;
    &lt;repository&gt;
        &lt;id&gt;glassfish-extras-repository&lt;/id&gt;
        &lt;url&gt;http://download.java.net/maven/glassfish/org/glassfish/extras&lt;/url&gt;
    &lt;/repository&gt;
&lt;/repositories&gt;

&lt;dependencies&gt;
    &lt;dependency&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;org.glassfish.extras&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;glassfish-embedded-all&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;version&gt;3.1.1&lt;/version&gt;
        &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
    &lt;dependency&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;javax&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;javaee-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;version&gt;6.0&lt;/version&gt;
        &lt;scope&gt;compile&lt;/scope&gt;
        &lt;type&gt;jar&lt;/type&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;/dependencies&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>Works as expected with Maven</h3>

<p>From my understanding, because of the <code>&lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;</code> of the glassfish dependency, it will not be included in the regular <code>compile</code> phase. </p>

<p>Because both dependencies would be included in the <code>test-compile</code> phase, I was sure to place the glassfish dependency before the javaee-api dependency so that the former would be used in preference to the latter when compiling the test classes. And so, when using just Maven to build, this configuration is not a problem.</p>

<h3>Does not work as expected within Eclipse</h3>

<p>However, when using m2e and Eclipse, the glassfish dependency is listed in my build path:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nluHG.png"" alt=""dependency listed on build path""></p>

<p>Because the glassfish dependency is listed before the java-ee-api dependency, it appears that Eclipse is using the wrong lib (glassfish, instead of the java-ee-api) to validate / compile / look up javadocs. (Actually, I am not 100% sure that compilation is using the wrong lib - it depends on whether under the hood Eclipse is using Maven to perform the compilation used when validating code, and I don't know if it is or not - but the javadoc lookup is definitely referencing the wrong lib)</p>

<h3>The Question</h3>

<p>How can I stop Eclipse from using the glassfish lib except for when running unit tests? I want to ensure my compilation / javadoc lookups are ocurring on the api, not a particular implementation of that api.</p>

After following those instructions, it was initially throwing a ClassNotFoundException complaining that it couldn't find ""example.hello.Hello"".  I was able to resolve that by starting the rmiregistry FROM the <em>destDir</em> directory in the tutorial, since rmiregistry, apparently, uses its initial starting directory as part of its classpath.</p>

<p>I started on my other test app after that, and I was fine until I started to use third-party jar files in my server class.  Now Registry.bind() throws a ClassNotFoundException if my server class references anything in any jar file since the rmiregistry app doesn't know about those jar files.</p>

<p>What I want to achieve is sorting on the 3 columns only on first level nodes. Say I want to sort it by ascending date, it would end up like that: </p>

<p>As I see it, it ressembles to simple table sorting (so the hierarchical limitation invoked for disabling sorting is lifted).</p>

<p>I see 2 possibilities to do that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Re-enable the sorting mechanism available in JXTable to benefit from everything that is already implemented (sorter, sorting by clicking on the headers,...) and only sort nodes of the first level (as their children would still have the same parent).</li>
<li>Implement the basic stuff I need (sorting by clicking on the headers mostly), have a list of model-row-ids in JXSortableTreeModel that I sort and override convertRowIndexToModel which would allow (I think) to display my item sorted as I want.</li>
</ol>

<p>My favourite is of course the first one but I don't know how to achieve it. The first limitation is that I don't know how to re-enable sorting as JXTreeTable overrides setSortable() (and all related methods) and I don't know how to directly access the implementation of the method in JXTable (that's a Java problem). I could simply copy the code of JXTreeTable and remove the overrides but that's not an option in my opinion.</p>

<p>Say I solve this, how would I limit the sorting to the first-level nodes? Even after looking at the source, I'm rather clueless about how to do that.</p>

<p>With the second one, I loose all the benefits of existing code but I see a practical way to achieve what I want (for now, at least. Who knows if won't want to filter the data on all rows?).</p>

<p>Is there another way to go? If not, which one of my solutions should I choose? Any insightful comments?</p>

<p>Many thanks in advance!</p>

<p>But I'm not sure how to go about automating this. I'm just starting to use Jersey and am not clear on how to use it to return JSON.  It sounds like it has a way to do this built in, but it looks like I need to add annotations to my POJOs.  Also, I read others saying that I need to use Jackson.  I've been googling and can't seem to locate a good and simple example of returning JSON from a Jersey resource.  Anyone know of any?  Or can you show me how to use Jackson or Jersey to create JSON for for the above example?</p>

These data are very similar as in the kind of operations that are performed on the data and are just different because they arrive n different ports. I went ahead and coded an implementation using Java's ServerSocket class, only to realize later that the accept() method of the ServerSocket class is block and my implementation cant afford that. So now i was thinking of implementing the same using Java NIO but after having gone through some tutorials i think i am more confused than how i started. It would be great if someone here could walk me through the whole process, even of it be in pseudo code or jus technical ""what to do next""'s.
This is what i plan to achieve.</p>

<p>Listen, like for ever on 2 ports by calling 2 similar threads.(non blocking)

<p>Using annotations how do you map a field in an entity which is a ""Map"" (Hashtable) of String to a given object? The object is annotated and instances of it are already stored in the hibernate databse.</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;class name=""Foo"" table=""foo""&gt;

    &lt;map role=""ages""&gt;

 &lt;/class&gt;

  &lt;map role=""ages""&gt;

2328230,13,"<p>I'm a relatively new hire, and I'm starting on a small, fairly simple project. The language that this project will be implemented in is still to be determined. The question basically boils down to - Java or Python? </p>

<p>Here's the dilemma: My manager would prefer it to be done in Python. I don't object to that, but I have no experience in Python. I'd really love to learn Python and think I could manage it fairly quickly (especially as it's a small project). BUT the project is due at the end of March and must be ready by then. So they'd rather have it in Java and on time than in Python and late, and they don't want to pressure me to do it in Python if I think I can't make it on time.</p>

<p>Sorry about the background - but my question basically is, how long does it take, on average, to adapt to a new language? I know this is subjective and personalized, and depends on how fast the particular programmer is... but talking about an average programmer, or even a somewhat fast one that picks up things quickly, what percentage of an increase does programming in a non-native language (but with similar concepts) cause? As in, if this project would take me about 2 weeks in Java or a .NET language, how much longer can it take me in Python? Can I assume that having double the amount of time (i.e. a new, unfamiliar language causes a 50% increase in programming time) is adequate?</p>

<p>And included in this question - from what I've heard, it seems to be pretty easy/intuitive to switch over from Java to Python. Is this true...?</p>

2341998,19,"<p>I'm a senior engineer working in a team of four others on a home-grown
content management application that drives a large US pro sports web
site. We have embarked upon this project some two years ago and chose
Java as our platform, though my question is not Java-specific. Since
we started, there has been some churn in our ranks. Each one of us has
a significant degree of latitude in deciding on implementation
details, although important decisions are made by consensus.</p>

<p>Ours is a relatively young project, however we are already at a point
when no single developer knows everything about the app. The primary
reasons for that are our quick pace of development, most of which
occurs in a crunch leading up to our sport's season opener; and the
fact that our test coverage is essentially 0.</p>

<p>We all understand the theoretical benefits of TDD and agree in
principle that the methodology would have improved our lives and code
quality if we had started out and stuck with it through the
years. This never took hold, and now we're in charge of an untested
codebase that still requires a lot of expansion and is actively used
in production and relied upon by the corporate structure.</p>

<p>Faced with this situation, I see only two possible solutions: (1)
retroactively write tests for existing code, or (2) re-write as much
of the app as is practical while fanatically adhering to TDD
principles. I perceive (1) as by and large not practical because we
have a hellish dependency graph within the project. Almost none of our
components can be tested in isolation; we don't know all the use
cases; and the uses cases will likely change during the testing push
due to business requirements or as a reaction to unforeseen issues. For
these reasons, we can't really be sure that our tests will turn out to
be high quality once we're done. There's a risk of leading the team
into a false sense of security whereby subtle bugs will creep in
without anyone noticing. Given the bleak prospects with regards to
ROI, it would be hard for myself or our team lead to justify this
endeavor to management.</p>

<p>Method (2) is more attractive as we'll be following the test-first
principle, thus producing code that's almost 100% covered right off the
bat. Even if the initial effort results in islands of covered code at
first, this will provide us with a significant beachhead on the way to
project-wide coverage and help decouple and isolate the various
components.</p>

<p>The downside in both cases is that our team's business-wise
productivity could either slow down significantly or evaporate
entirely during any testing push. We can not afford to do this during
the business-driven crunch, although it's followed by a relative lull
which we could exploit for our purposes.</p>

<p>In addition to choosing the right approach (either (1), (2), or
another as of yet unknown solution), I need help answering the
following question: How can my team ensure that our effort isn't
wasted in the long run by unmaintained tests and/or failure to write
new ones as business requirements roll on? I'm open to a wide range of
suggestions here, whether they involve carrots or sticks.</p>

<p>For reasons too long to list here, I'd really like to make this a Criteria query, not an HQL query (unless it's possible to add an HQL restriction on a Criteria object, in which case I'm all ears) or a raw SQL query.  Since according to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2321214/how-do-i-query-for-objects-with-a-value-in-a-string-collection-using-hibernate-cr"">How do I query for objects with a value in a String collection using Hibernate Criteria?</a> it is impossible to refer to elements of value-type collections using the CriteriaAPI I thought I'd resort to adding an SqlRestriction on my criteria object.</p>

<pre><code>Criteria crit = session.createCriteria(Person.class);
crit.add(Restrictions.sqlRestriction(""XXXXX.element='superman'"");
</code></pre>

<p>in the hopes that Hibernate will create an SQL statement like</p>

<pre><code>    select *
from
    Person this_ 
left outer join
    Person_aliases aliases2_ 
        on this_.id=aliases2_.Person_id 
where
    XXXXX.element='superman' 
</code></pre>

<p>However, I need to fill in the XXXXX with the table alias for the Person_aliases table in the SQL query, which in this case would be 'aliases2_'. I noticed that if I needed the reference to the Person table alias I could use {alias}.  But this won't work because Person is the primary table for this Criteria, not Person_aliases.</p>

<p>What do I fill in for the XXXXX?  If there is no nice substition token like {alias} then is there a way I could get hibernate to tell me what that alias is going to be? I noticed a method called generateAlias() org.hibernate.util.StringHelper class.  Would this help me predict what the alias would be?  </p>

<p>I'd really, really like to avoid hard coding 'aliases2_'.  </p>

9828489,11,"<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>As a Swing developer of ten years, I've been thrilled with the features introduced with JavaFX 2.0, especially the rich, fluent, high-level data-binding facilities. This facility alone is worth the cost of learning a new API (which is much less since abandoning FX script). It's going to have a direct impact on the readability and maintainably of my model/view synchronization code.</p>

<p>So far I'm having great success at first level and basic derived bindings, but am struggling to figure out the ""JavaFX way"" of binding one value to a value two or more levels of indirection in the data graph.</p>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>As shown in the code example below, I'm attempting to use <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/beans/binding/Bindings.html#select(javafx.beans.value.ObservableValue,%20java.lang.String...)"" rel=""nofollow""><code>javafx.beans.binding.Bindings.select()</code></a> to synchronize the text value of a Label with one of the contained properties of the currently selected item in a ComboBox. This code is a simple example of something more complex I'm trying to do, so I understand that it's not hard to do this with the lower level bindings API.  I'd like to know if it's possible with the higher-level fluent API, and if the <code>select(...)</code> method actually tracks changes in the indirect properties (i.e. update property if either the direct property or the selected subproperty change).</p>

<p>The documentation and examples on <code>select(...)</code> are sparse, so I'm hoping someone with advanced experience with this can tell me if I'm trying to use the API as designed, or if there's another way to use the high-level binding API to do what I want.</p>

<h2>Sample Code</h2>

<p>Here's the demo code. When run, there's a ComboBox with two items in it, and then two labels. The first label shows the <code>toString()</code> version of the selected item. The second label attempts to display one of the properties of the selected item, but only displays <code>null</code>.</p>

<p>I know there are a lot of questions about primitives with respect to arrays, autoboxing, etc., but I haven't seen it formulated in quite this way, and I haven't seen a decisive answer on how to interact with these arrays.</p>

<p>I suppose I could do something like:</p>

<pre><code>public static&lt;E extends Number&gt; boolean isValid(E value, List&lt;E&gt; numbers) {
    long theValue = value.longValue();
    for (Number validOption : numbers) {

<li>Could Java has been designed as to NOT have this need in the first place?</li>
<li>What would the negative consequences (if any) of such design be?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Can you restrict <code>setAccessible</code> to legitimate uses only?

<ul>
<li>Is it only through <code>SecurityManager</code>?

<ul>
<li>How does it work? Whitelist/blacklist, granularity, etc?</li>
<li>Is it common to have to configure it in your applications?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Can I write my classes to be <code>setAccessible</code>-proof regardless of <code>SecurityManager</code> configuration?

2484425,12,"<p>With the help of people on <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2479295/how-the-simples-gui-countdown-is-supposed-to-work"">stackoverflow</a> I was able to get the following working code of a simple GUI countdown (which just displays a window counting down seconds). My main problem with this code is the <code>invokeLater</code> stuff.</p>

<p>As far as I understand <code>invokeLater</code>, it sends a task to the event dispatching thread (EDT) and then the EDT executes this task whenever it ""can"" (whatever that means). <strong>Is that right?</strong></p>

<p>To my understanding, the code works like this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In the <code>main</code> method we use <code>invokeLater</code> to show the window (<code>showGUI</code> method). In other words, the code displaying the window will be executed in the EDT.</p></li>
<li><p>In the <code>main</code> method we also start the <code>counter</code> and the counter (by construction) is executed in another thread (so it is not in the event dispatching thread). Right?</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>counter</code> is executed in a separate thread and periodically it calls <code>updateGUI</code>. <code>updateGUI</code> is supposed to update the GUI. And the GUI is working in the EDT. So, <code>updateGUI</code> should also be executed in the EDT. It is the reason why the code for the <code>updateGUI</code> is enclosed in <code>invokeLater</code>. Is that right?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>What is not clear to me is why we call the <code>counter</code> from the EDT. Anyway, it is not executed in the EDT. It starts immediately, a new thread and the <code>counter</code> is executed there. So, <strong>why can we not call the <code>counter</code> in the main method after the <code>invokeLater</code> block?</strong></p>

<p>As far as I can tell, the only feedback that I have from Eclipse is</p>

<p>This is all wonderful, but <strong><em>what is the error?</em></strong></p>

<p>Is there a ""show me the next error"" button somewhere?</p>

<p>In the past, on other Eclipse projects, I've notice other little red X's on folders containing source files with errors, the little red X's appear on the source files as well. I scanned (manually) through all of the source files and I haven't found any other red X's (again, where is the ""next error"" button?).</p>

<p>If I select the ""Proceed"" button I am greeted with a <code>java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError</code> for my main class, which makes me suspect a classpath issue. I've checked the classpath, and I'm fairly certain that it's correct. Is there a way to see the <em>exact</em> jvm command line that Eclipse is invoking? I realize that it might be invoking the JVM programmatically, and not on a ""real"" command line. In any case, is there a way, other than the run configuration dialog, to see what is <em>actually happening</em> when I hit the ""Proceed"" button?</p>

<p><strong>Package rename test</strong></p>

<p>Procedure:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a new package com.oldname.test.renametest.subpackage.</li>
<li><p>Add a new class under renametest called RenameTest0.java and containing:</p>

<pre>class RenameTest0 {
    public RenameTest0() {
        showMessage();
        new RenameTest1();
    }
    public static void showMessage() {
        System.out.println(""RenameTest0!"");
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new RenameTest0();
    }
}</pre></li>
<li><p>Add a new class under renametest.subpackage containing:</p>

<pre>class RenameTest1 {
    public RenameTest1() {
        showMessage();
        RenameTest0.showMessage();
    }
    public static void showMessage() {
        System.out.println(""RenameTest1!"");
    }
}</pre></li>
<li><p>Test that RenameTest0 runs fine.</p></li>
<li>Commit.</li>
<li>Change the messages of both of the classes.</li>
<li>Commit.</li>
<li>Again, change the message of one class and commit (just creating some history).</li>
<li>Apply procedure proposed above (the three steps in the original message) for renaming package renametest to testrename.</li>
<li>Commit.</li>
<li>Test run.</li>
<li>Modify the messages again and test.</li>
<li>Commit.</li>
<li>Try to roll back to the version when both messages have been changed simultaneously the first time.</li>
<li>If everything worked fine to this point, it looks good, no?</li>
</ol>

<p>Result of test:</p>

<ul>
<li>Note on step 9: Had to do it in <em>reverse order</em> (Eclipse rename THEN TortoiseSVN rename.), else it was getting complicated, as TSVN create a new folder/package and marks the old one for deletion... So you can't rename for Eclipse unless you put the old package somewhere else in the meantime to prevent losing .svn folders, etc. etc. Didn't look like a good idea to go further with this method. (Note to myself: don't forget to tick the checkbox for recursive package renaming!)</li>
<li>Note on step 14: Worked! We can see previous versions; all we have to do is tell not to break on copy/move and it's ok. Once reverted to a version before the rename, <em>the package names are not back to the good name though</em>, probably that refactoring it again would do it.</li>
<li>End note: I was surprised to have to do the critical steps in reverse order. To do that right in the middle of this first package rename try, I had to roll back some TSVN and manual modifications, casting a little doubt on the repeatable nature of the exact results of this procedure. I will have to do a second test to confirm it's validity. <em>To sum up: it looks good, but needs further testing.</em></li>

<p>I'm attempting to programatically execute the same <code>Action</code> that occurs when the user either clicks on the <code>View</code> > <code>Collapse All</code> button or right-clicks within the editor window and then <code>Code Folding</code> > <code>Fold All</code>.</p>

<p><strong>What I tried\found so far:</strong></p>

<ul>

<p>My problem is that I can't find a way to actually <em>activate</em> the <code>Action</code>.</p>

<p>Any ideas / alternatives?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT1</strong>: After digging a bit in <a href=""http://undocumentedmatlab.com/matlab-java-book"" rel=""nofollow"">""the book""</a>, I think I came even closer than before (but still not quite there). Quoting from the book:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Java GUI components often use an<code>ActionMap</code>to store runnable<code>Actions</code>that are
  invoked by listeners on mouse, keyboard, property, or container events. Unlike object methods,<code>Actions</code>cannot be directly invoked by MATLAB.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then a workaround is explained which involves roughly: getting some sort of an <code>Action</code> object; creating an <code>ActionEvent</code> and invoking <code>Action</code>'s <code>actionPerformed</code>   with the <code>ActionEvent</code> as an argument, as implemented below:</p>

<pre><code>import java.awt.event.*;
jEd = com.mathworks.mlservices.MLEditorServices.getEditorApplication.getActiveEditor;
jAm = com.mathworks.mde.editor.ActionManager(jEd);
jAc = jAm.getAction(com.mathworks.mde.editor.EditorAction('collapse-all-folds'));
jAe = ActionEvent(jAm, ActionEvent.ACTION_PERFORMED, '');
jAc.actionPerformed(jAe);
</code></pre>

<p>This code runs without errors - but does (seemingly?) nothing. I suspect that I'm calling <code>ActionEvent</code> and <code>actionPerformed</code> on the wrong objects (<code>ActionManager</code> has possibly nothing to do with this problem at all).</p>

<hr>

<p>P.S.</p>

<p>In Hugh transform, there are specifically chosen parameters in the hyper-square of the parameter space. Its complexity $O(A^{m-2})$ where m is the amount of parameters where you see that with more than there parameters the problem is difficult. <em>A</em> is the size of the image space. Foxit reader is using most probably 3 parameters in their implementation. Edges are easy to detect well which can ensure the efficiency and must be done before Hugh transform. Corrupted pages are simply ignored. Other two parameters are still unknown but I think they must be nodes and some intersections. How these intersections are computed is unknown? The formulation of the exact problem is unknown.</p>

The repetition was causing a few issues for ourselves (primarily typos or copy/paste errors) but it also causes issues in that it increases the amount of text our translator has to translate.</p>

<p>The solution I came up with went something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class ExpandingResourceBundleControl extends ResourceBundle.Control {
  public static final ResourceBundle.Control EXPANDING =
    new ExpandingResourceBundleControl();

  private ExpandingResourceBundleControl() { }

  @Override
  public ResourceBundle newBundle(String baseName, Locale locale, String format,

    throws IllegalAccessException, InstantiationException, IOException {

      ResourceBundle inner = super.newBundle(baseName, locale, format, loader, reload);
      return inner == null ? null : new ExpandingResourceBundle(inner, loader);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>ExpandingResourceBundle</code> delegates to the real resource bundle but performs conversion of {{this.kind.of.thing}} to look up the key in the resources.</p>

<p>Every time you want to get one of these, you have to go:</p>

<pre><code>ResourceBundle.getBundle(""com/acme/app/Bundle"", EXPANDING);
</code></pre>

<p>And this works fine -- for a while.</p>

<p>What eventually happens is that some new code (in our case autogenerated code which was spat out of Matisse) looks up the same resource bundle without specifying the custom control.  This appears to be non-reproducible if you write a simple unit test which calls it with and then without, but it occurs when the application is run for real.  Somehow the cache inside <code>ResourceBundle</code> ejects the good value and replaces it with the broken one.  I am yet to figure out why and Sun's jar files were compiled without debug info so debugging it is a chore.</p>

<li><p>Is there some way of globally setting the default ResourceBundle.Control that I might not be aware of?  That would solve everything rather elegantly.</p></li>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>I have an abstract class that does an operation <strong>in the constructor</strong> depending on the value of one of its fields.
The problem is that the <strong>value of this field will change depending on the subclass</strong>.
How can I do so that the operation is done on the value of the field redefined by the subclass ?</p>

<p>If I just ""override"" the field in the subclass the operation is done on the value of the field in the abstract class.</p>

<p>I'm open to any solution that would <strong>ensure that the operation will be done during the instantiation of the subclass</strong> (ie putting the operation in a method called by each subclass in the constructor is not a valid solution, because someone might extend the abstract class and forget to call the method).</p>

<p>Also, I don't want to give the value of the field as an argument of the constructor.</p>

<p>Is there any solution to do that, or should I just change my design ?</p>

<hr>

<h2>Edit:</h2>

<p>My subclasses are actually some tools used by my main program, so the constructor has to be public and take exactly the arguments with which they will be called:</p>

<pre><code>tools[0]=new Hand(this);
tools[1]=new Pencil(this);
tools[2]=new AddObject(this);
</code></pre>

<p>(the subclasses are Hand, Pencil and AddObject that all extend the abstract class Tool)</p>

<p>That's why I don't want to change the constructor.</p>

<p>The solution I'm about to use is to slightly change the above code to:</p>

<pre><code>tools[0]=new Hand(this);
tools[0].init();
tools[1]=new Pencil(this);
tools[1].init();
tools[2]=new AddObject(this);
tools[2].init();
</code></pre>

17793249,19,"<p>I've encountered some curious behavior in my application when managing Fragments and I was wondering if SO could help shed some light onto why this happens.  </p>

<p>I have two Fragments, we'll call them Fragment A and Fragment B.  The general flow of my application is that when the user interacts with Fragment A in some way, Fragment B is shown by calling <code>fragmentTransaction.replace()</code> (this happens in all cases).  When I show Fragment B, I add Fragment A to the back stack; then, when the user presses the back button on Fragment B, Fragment A gets shown again by popping from the back stack.</p>

<p>That's all well and good, but today I discovered that there is a flow from Fragment B which calls <code>fragmentTransaction.replace()</code>, replacing Fragment B with the same instance of Fragment A that is currently on the back stack.</p>

<p>In and of itself there's nothing wrong with that, however the strange behavior arises when I go back from Fragment A into Fragment B.  If I called <code>fragmentTransaction.replace()</code>, the <code>onCreate()</code> method of Fragment B is not called.  </p>

<p>However, if I popped Fragment A from the back stack and then replaced it with Fragment B, the <code>onCreate()</code> method of Fragment B is fired.  Why is this?</p>

<p>Note that all instances of Fragment A and Fragment B are created at the time their host Activity is launched.</p>

<p>Edit for clarification.  The case where <code>onCreate()</code> is called a second time is the following: Attach Fragment A => replace with Fragment B, adding Fragment A to the back stack => pop Fragment A using <code>popBackStack()</code> => replace Fragment A with Fragment B again.</p>

2618617,9,"<p>Hi I am developing an application that needs to work with a complex domain model using Hibernate. This application uses Spring MVC and using the domain objects in the presentation layer is very messy so I think I should use DTO's that go to and from my service layer so that these match what I need in my views. Now lets assume I have a CarLease entity whose properties are not simple java primitives but it's composed with other entities like Make, Model, etc</p>

<pre><code>    public class CarLease {
        private Make make;
        Private Model model;
        .
        .
        .
    }

<p>most properties are in this fashion and they are selectable using drop down selects on the jsp view, each will post back an ID to the controller. </p>

<p>Now considering some standard use cases: create, edit, display</p>

<p>How would you go about modeling the presentation DTO's to be used as form backing objects and communication between presentation and service layers?? </p>

<p>Would you create a different DTO for each case (create, edit, display), would you make DTO's for the complex attributes? if so where would you translate the ID to entity?</p>

<p>how and where would you handle validation, DTO/Domain assembly, what would you return from service layer methods? (create, edit, get)</p>

<p>As you can see, I now I will benefit by separating my view from the domain objects (very complex with lots of stuff I don't need.) but I am having a hard time finding any real world examples and best practices for this. I need some architecture guidance from top to bottom, please keep in mind I will use Spring MVC in case that may leverage on your anwser.</p>

2745796,10,"<p>Currently, I have a bunch of Java classes that implement a <code>Processor</code> interface, meaning they all have a <code>processRequest(String key)</code> method. The idea is that each class has a few (say, &lt;10) member <code>Strings</code>, and each of those maps to a method in that class via the <code>processRequest</code> method, like so:</p>

<pre><code>class FooProcessor implements Processor
{
    String key1 = ""abc"";
    String key2 = ""def"";
    String key3 = ""ghi"";
    // and so on...

    String processRequest(String key)
    {
        String toReturn = null;
        if (key1.equals(key)) toReturn = method1();
        else if (key2.equals(key)) toReturn = method2();
        else if (key3.equals(key)) toReturn = method3();
        // and so on...

        return toReturn;
    }

    String method1() { // do stuff }
    String method2() { // do other stuff }
    String method3() { // do other other stuff }
    // and so on...
}
</code></pre>

<p>You get the idea.</p>

<p>This was working fine for me, but now I need a runtime-accessible mapping from key to function; not every function <em>actually</em> returns a String (some return void) and I need to dynamically access the return type (using reflection) of each function in each class that there's a key for. I already have a manager that knows about all the keys, but <em>not</em> the mapping from key to function.</p>

<p>My first instinct was to replace this mapping using <code>if-else</code> statements with a <code>Map&lt;String, Function&gt;</code>, like I could do in Javascript. But, Java doesn't support first-class functions so I'm out of luck there. I could probably dig up a third-party library that lets me work with first-class functions, but I haven't seen any yet, and I doubt that I need an entire new library.</p>

<p>I also thought of putting these <code>String</code> keys into an array and using reflection to invoke the methods by name, but I see two downsides to this method:</p>

<ul>
<li>My keys would have to be named the same as the method - or be named in a particular, consistent way so that it's easy to map them to the method name.</li>
<li>This seems WAY slower than the <code>if-else</code> statements I have right now. Efficiency is something of a concern because these methods will tend to get called pretty frequently, and I want to minimize unnecessary overhead.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><strong>TL; DR:</strong> I'm looking for a clean, minimal-overhead way to map a <code>String</code> to some sort of a <code>Function</code> object that I can invoke and call (something like) <code>getReturnType()</code> on. I don't especially mind using a 3rd-party library if it <em>really</em> fits my needs. I also don't mind using reflection, though I would strongly prefer to avoid using reflection every single time I do a method lookup - maybe using some caching strategy that combines the <code>Map</code> with reflection.</p>

2756233,9,"<p><strong>Quick background</strong><br>
I'm a Java developer who's been playing around with C++ in my free/bored time.</p>

<p><strong>Preface</strong><br>
In C++, you often see pop taking an argument by reference:</p>

<pre><code>void pop(Item&amp; removed);
</code></pre>

<p>I understand that it is nice to ""fill in"" the parameter with what you removed.  That totally makes sense to me.  This way, the person who asked to remove the top item can have a look at what was removed.</p>

<p>However, if I were to do this in Java, I'd do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Item pop() throws StackException;
</code></pre>

<p>This way, after the pop we return either: NULL as a result, an Item, or an exception would be thrown.</p>

<p>My C++ text book shows me the example above, but I see plenty of stack implementations taking no arguments (<a href=""http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/stack/pop/"" rel=""noreferrer"">stl stack</a> for example).</p>

<p><strong>The Question</strong><br>
How should one implement the pop function in C++?</p>

Why?</p>

2758704,21,"<p><strong>I have this friend....</strong></p>

<p>I have this friend who works on a java ee application (j2ee) application started in the early 2000's. Currently they add a feature here and there, but have a large codebase. Over the years the team has shrunk by 70%.</p>

<p>[Yes, the ""i have this friend is"". It's me, attempting to humorously inject teenage high-school counselor shame into the mix]</p>

<p><strong>Java, Vintage 2002</strong></p>

<p>The application uses EJB 2.1, struts 1.x, DAO's etc with straight jdbc calls (mixture of stored procedures and prepared statements). No ORM. For caching they use a mixture of OpenSymphony OSCache and a home-grown cache layer. </p>

<p>Over the last few years, they have spent effort to modernize the UI using
ajax techniques and libraries. This largely involves javascript libaries
(jquery, yui, etc). </p>

<p><strong>Client Side</strong></p>

<p>On the client side, the lack of upgrade path from struts1 to struts2 discouraged them from migrating to struts2. Other web frameworks became popular (wicket, spring , jsf). Struts2 was not the ""clear winner"".  Migrating all the existing UI from Struts1 to Struts2/wicket/etc did not seem to present much marginal benefit at a very high cost. They did not want to have a patchwork of technologies-du-jour (subsystem X in Struts2, subsystem Y in Wicket, etc.) so developer write new features using Struts 1.</p>

<p><strong>Server Side</strong></p>

<p>On the server side, they looked into moving to ejb 3, but never had a big impetus. The developers are all comfortable with ejb-jar.xml, EJBHome, EJBRemote, that ""ejb 2.1 as is"" represented the path of least resistance. </p>

<p>One big complaint about the ejb environment: programmers still pretend ""ejb server runs in separate jvm than servlet engine"".  No app server (jboss/weblogic) has ever enforced this separation.  The team has never deployed the ejb server on a separate box then the app server.  </p>

<p>The ear file contains multiple copies of the same jar file; one for the 'web layer' (foo.war/WEB-INF/lib) and one for the server side (foo.ear/). The app server only loads one jar. The duplications makes for ambiguity.</p>

<p><strong>Caching</strong></p>

<p>As for caching, they use several cache implementations: OpenSymphony cache and a homegrown cache. Jgroups provides clustering support </p>

<p><strong>Now What?</strong></p>

<p>The question:
The team currently has spare cycles to  to invest in modernizing the application? Where would the smart investor spend them?</p>

<p>The main criteria: </p>

<p>1) productivity gains. Specifically reducing the time to develope new subsystems features and reduced maintenance.
 2) performance/scalability.  </p>

<p>They do not care about fashion or techno-du-jour street cred.</p>

<p>What do you all recommend?</p>

<p><em>On the persistence side</em>
Switch everything (or new development only) to JPA/JPA2?<br>
Straight hibernate?
Wait for Java EE 6?</p>

<p><em>On the client/web-framework side</em>: 
Migrate (some or all) to struts2? 
wicket? 
jsf/jsf2?</p>

<p><em>As for caching:</em> 
terracotta? 
ehcache?

<p>I'm trying to reproduce the results from <a href=""https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/3.3/reference/en/html/batch.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hibernate's tutorial</a>. I've created a test function that will try to insert 30 customers, just like in example:</p>

<pre><code>//Batch inserting test entities
//This code is inside transaction already, so I'm not creating a new one
entityManager.flush();
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 30; ++i) {
    Customer customer = new Customer(""Customer"" + i, (i + 5) * 1000, ""Position "" + i);
    entityManager.persist(customer);
    if (i % 20 == 0) {
        entityManager.flush();
        entityManager.clear();
    }
}

    private long salary;
    @Column

    public Customer() {

    }

    public Customer(String name, long salary, String position) {
        this.id = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
        this.name = name;
        this.salary = salary;
        this.position = position;
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>What I'm expecting to see is 2 insert statements, one for 20 records and one for 10 records. However, when I open postgres logs, I see 30 insert statements, each inserting only 1 row. I've double checked that it's possible to insert multiple rows using postgres.</p>

<p>I believe that the problem is caused by the <code>hibernate.jdbc.batch_size 20</code> parameter, which I'm supposed to pass to hibernate. However, since I'm using spring boot, the only configuration file I have is application.properties. So I've tried inserting it there:</p>

<pre><code>hibernate.jdbc.batch_size=20
hibernate.order_inserts=true
hibernate.order_updates=true
hibernate.jdbc.batch_versioned_data=true
spring.jpa.hibernate.jdbc.batch_size=20
spring.jpa.hibernate.order_inserts=true
spring.jpa.hibernate.order_updates=true
spring.jpa.hibernate.jdbc.batch_versioned_data=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.jdbc.batch_size=20
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.order_inserts=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.order_updates=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.jdbc.batch_versioned_data=true
</code></pre>

<p>According to this <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/25720590/333278"">answer</a>, this should be enough, but
I've also tried copying these parameters to the <code>hibernate.properties</code> file inside my jar and supplied the parameter via command line: <code>-Dhibernate.jdbc.batch_size=20</code> as stated in this <a href=""https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/3.3/reference/en-US/html/session-configuration.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>None of this helps.<br>
I also can't find a way to read batch size property in my code. It seems that most objects mentioned in hibernate's documentation doesn't exist in spring boot application.<br>
How can I enable hibernate's batch insert inside spring boot application?</p>

<p><strong>I've created a minimal working example which reproduces the issue:</strong>

<hr>

<p>After receiving the answer from Vlad Mihalcea I realized that yes, in fact batch statements are working, at least on hibernate and jdbc levels.</p>

<p>However, postgres logs themselves show very interesting behavior: they are almost identical for the case of batch inserts and normal inserts.</p>

<p>What I was initially expecting to see was that hibernate would be using statements like this:</p>

<pre><code>test=# INSERT INTO customer (name, position, salary, id) values ('CustomerX', 'PositionX', '1000', 'idX'), ('CUSTOMERY', 'POSITIONY', '1000', 'idY');
</code></pre>

<p>Which would produce log records similar to this:</p>

<pre><code>2015-12-15 11:43:33.238 MSK LOG:  statement: INSERT INTO customer (name, position, salary, id) values ('CustomerX', 'PositionX', '1000', 'idX'), ('CUSTOMERY', 'POSITIONY', '1000', 'idY');
</code></pre>

<p>However, that's not the case.<br>
When batch insertion is enabled (p6spy shows that statements are, in fact, batched), postgres will produce logs similar to this:</p>

<p>So, the only difference between the two is when batch is disabled, postgres will take tiny bit more time to realize that it should reuse prepared statements.</p>

<p>So I decided to run performance tests to confirm this.<br>
I tried inserting 30.000 records into empty database.<br>
With batching disabled, it took 334ms.<br>
With batching enabled, it took 4650ms!  </p>

<p>So then I removed all calls to entityManager.flush (leaving only entityManager.clear) and the time dropped to 320ms. I don't know why hibernate's tutorial advises using flush. I guess that's just a mistake.</p>

<p>So I guess the bottom line is this: <strong>the batching is working, but it doesn't provide any real benefits (at least for postgres). Furthermore, using it improperly (as in tutorial) can lead to a terrible, terrible results. Use at your own risk and always measure real performance increase.</strong></p>

<p>Points I have noticed:</p>

<ul>
<li>I don't want an intent, I need the camera preview so that later I can
do other things with it like taking a picture.</li>
<li>If I try to replace the imageView with surfaceView I hit an error ""rendering problem class could not be found :   CardboardOverlayView.java"" in common_ui.xml. But the file is there and it's a known and reported bug. </li>
<li>The other way I can think of doing it is capture and save image every second and update 2 image view's with the image. However I'm
not sure if that's the right way to do it or how to do it.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have also checked all the links that are available in stack overflow since last 3 days. The closest to my question was <em><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17223507/android-multuple-camera-preview"">Android multuple camera preview</a></em> - but it's not quite exactly solves my question.
I have also gone through the Android - Camera documentation and learned about how they are using cameraPreview and surfaceView.</p>

<p>So my question is what do I need to do now to be able to see the CameraPreview [or the surfaceView that holds the CameraPreview] instead of the Imageview so that I cam provide live camera feed like a split screen in landscape mode?</p>

<p>I hope the question is detailed enough.Still if you need any further info, just ask.</p>

26339237,25,"<p>This question might sound weird to Java people but if you try to explain this, it would be great.</p>

<p>In these days I am clearing some of Java's very basic concept. 
So I come to Inheritance and Interface topic of Java. </p>

<p>While reading this I found that Java does not support Multiple Inheritance and also understood that, what I am not able to understand that why everywhere Diamond figure issue(At least 4 class to create diamond) is discussed to explain this behavior, Can't we understand this issue using 3 classes only.</p>

<p>Say, I have class A and class B, these two classes are different (they are not child class of common class) but they have one common method and they look like :-</p>

<pre><code>class A {
    void add(int a, int b) {

    }
}

class B {
    void add(int a, int b) {

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Ok,Now say if Java supports Multiple inheritance and if there is one class which is the subclass of A and B like this :-</p>

<pre><code>class C extends A,B{ //If this was possible
    @Override
    void add(int a, int b) { 
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
        super.add(a, b); //Which version of this, from A or B ?
    }
 }
</code></pre>

<p>then compiler will not be able to find which method to call whether from A or B and that is why Java does not support Multiple Inheritance. So is there any thing wrong with this concept ? </p>

<p>When I read about this topic I was able to understand Diamond issue, but I am not able to understand why people are not giving example with three class (If this is valid one, because we used only 3 classes to demonstrate issue so its easy to understand by comparing it to Diamond issue.)</p>

<p>Let me know whether this example does not fit to explain issue or this can also be  referred to understand issue. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
I got one close vote here stating that question is not clear. 
Here is main question :-</p>

18006137,8,"<p>I was wondering what I am doing wrong here to authenticate a user. I have an application where the user goes through several steps to activate their account, and upon doing so I would like to bypass the login form and take them directly to their dashboard.</p>

<p>Here is what my automated login function looks like:</p>

<pre><code>protected void automatedLogin(String username, String password, HttpServletRequest request) {

        try {
            // Must be called from request filtered by Spring Security, otherwise SecurityContextHolder is not updated
            CustomUserDetailsService udService = new CustomUserDetailsService(userDAO, request);
            UserDetails uDetails = udService.loadUserByUsername(username);
            UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken token = new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(uDetails, password);
            token.setDetails(new WebAuthenticationDetails(request));
            DaoAuthenticationProvider authenticator = new DaoAuthenticationProvider();
            Authentication authentication = authenticator.authenticate(token);
            SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(authentication);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(null);
        }

    }
</code></pre>

<p>I must use the DaoAuthenticationProvider class as my authentication provider. I have verified that I am getting a UserDetails model containing the correct credentials, ID, authority roles, etc.</p>

<p>When it calls the authenticate method I run into a Null Pointer somewhere along the way in the DaoAuthenticationProvider class:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I'm really not sure what is null, as I don't have the source code available.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>
I was able to find the source code here - <a href=""https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-security/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/authentication/dao/DaoAuthenticationProvider.java"">https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-security/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/authentication/dao/DaoAuthenticationProvider.java</a></p>

<p>I was able to get around the Null Pointer by explicitly setting the UserDetailsService on the object:</p>

<pre><code>authenticator.setUserDetailsService(udService);
</code></pre>

<p>But now I get bad credentials exception when I know the password provided is correct, because I've seen it in the debugger in the UserDetails object set earlier in the code.</p>

<p>Summary: Certain custom <code>BeanInfo</code>s and <code>PropertyDescriptor</code>s that work in JDK 1.6 fail in JDK 1.7, and some only fail after Garbage Collection has run and cleared certain SoftReferences.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Edit: This will also break the <code>ExtendedBeanInfo</code> in Spring 3.1 as noted at the bottom of the post.</p>
  
  <p>Edit: If you invoke sections 7.1 or 8.3 of the JavaBeans spec, explain
  exactly where those parts of the spec <em>require</em> anything.  The
  language is not imperative or normative in those sections.  The
  language in those sections is that of examples, which are at best
  ambiguous as a specification.  Furthermore, the <code>BeanInfo</code> API
  specifically allows one to change the default behavior, and it is
  clearly broken in the second example below.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Java Beans specification looks for default setter methods with a void return type, but it allows customization of the getter and setter methods through a <code>java.beans.PropertyDescriptor</code>.  The simplest way to use it has been to specify the names of the getter and setter.</p>

<pre><code>new PropertyDescriptor(""foo"", MyClass.class, ""getFoo"", ""setFoo"");
</code></pre>

<p>This has worked in JDK 1.5 and JDK 1.6 to specify the setter name even when its return type is not void as in the test case below:</p>

<pre><code>import java.beans.IntrospectionException;
import java.beans.PropertyDescriptor;
import org.testng.annotations.*;

/**
 * Shows what has worked up until JDK 1.7.
 */
public class PropertyDescriptorTest
{
    private int i;
    public int getI() { return i; }
    // A setter that my people call ""fluent"".
    public PropertyDescriptorTest setI(final int i) { this.i = i; return this; }

    @Test
    public void fluentBeans() throws IntrospectionException
    {
        // This throws an exception only in JDK 1.7.
        final PropertyDescriptor pd = new PropertyDescriptor(""i"",
                           PropertyDescriptorTest.class, ""getI"", ""setI"");

        assert pd.getReadMethod() != null;
        assert pd.getWriteMethod() != null;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The example of custom <code>BeanInfo</code>s, which allow the programmatic control of <code>PropertyDescriptor</code>s in the Java Beans specification all use void return types for their setters, but nothing in the specification indicates that those examples are normative, and now the behavior of this low-level utility has changed in the new Java classes, which happens to have broken some code on which I am working.</p>

<p>There are numerous changes in in the <code>java.beans</code> package between JDK 1.6 and 1.7, but the one that causes this test to fail appears to be in this diff:</p>

<pre><code>@@ -240,11 +289,16 @@

        }

-       writeMethod = Introspector.findMethod(cls, writeMethodName, 1, 
-                 (type == null) ? null : new Class[] { type });

+            }
        try {
        setWriteMethod(writeMethod);
        } catch (IntrospectionException ex) {
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of simply accepting the method with the correct name and parameters, the <code>PropertyDescriptor</code> is now also checking the return type to see whether it is null, so the fluent setter no longer gets used.  The <code>PropertyDescriptor</code> throws an <code>IntrospectionException</code> in this case: ""Method not found: setI"".</p>

<p>However, the problem is much more insidious than the simple test above.  Another way to specify the getter and setter methods in the <code>PropertyDescriptor</code> for a custom <code>BeanInfo</code> is to use the actual <code>Method</code> objects:</p>

<pre><code>@Test
public void fluentBeansByMethod()
    throws IntrospectionException, NoSuchMethodException
{
    final Method readMethod = PropertyDescriptorTest.class.getMethod(""getI"");
    final Method writeMethod = PropertyDescriptorTest.class.getMethod(""setI"",
                                                                 Integer.TYPE);

    final PropertyDescriptor pd = new PropertyDescriptor(""i"", readMethod,
                                                         writeMethod);

    assert pd.getReadMethod() != null;
    assert pd.getWriteMethod() != null;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now the above code <em>will</em> pass a unit test in both 1.6 and in 1.7, but the code will begin to fail at some point in time during the life of the JVM instance owing to the very same change that causes the first example to fail immediately.  In the second example the only indication that anything has gone wrong comes when trying to use the custom <code>PropertyDescriptor</code>.  The setter is null, and most utility code takes that to mean that the property is read-only.</p>

<p>The code in the diff is inside <code>PropertyDescriptor.getWriteMethod()</code>.  It executes when the <code>SoftReference</code> holding the actual setter <code>Method</code> is empty.  This code is invoked by the <code>PropertyDescriptor</code> constructor in the first example that takes the accessor method <em>names</em> above because initially there is no <code>Method</code> saved in the <code>SoftReference</code>s holding the actual getter and setter.</p>

<p>In the second example the read method and write method are stored in <code>SoftReference</code> objects in the <code>PropertyDescriptor</code> by the constructor, and at first these will contain references to the <code>readMethod</code> and <code>writeMethod</code> getter and setter <code>Method</code>s given to the constructor.  If at some point those Soft references are cleared as the Garbage Collector is allowed to do (and it will do), then the <code>getWriteMethod()</code> code will see that the <code>SoftReference</code> gives back null, and it will try to discover the setter. <em>This time</em>, using the same code path inside <code>PropertyDescriptor</code> that causes the first example to fail in JDK 1.7, it will set the write <code>Method</code> to <code>null</code> because the return type is not <code>void</code>. (The return type is <em>not</em> part of a Java <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se5.0/html/classes.html#8.4.2"" rel=""noreferrer"">method signature</a>.)</p>

<p>Having the behavior change like this over time when using a custom <code>BeanInfo</code> can be extremely confusing.  Trying to duplicate the conditions that cause the Garbage Collector to clear those particular <code>SoftReferences</code> is also tedious (though maybe some instrumenting mocking may help.)</p>

<p>The Spring <code>ExtendedBeanInfo</code> class has tests similar to those above.  Here is an actual Spring 3.1.1 unit test from <code>ExtendedBeanInfoTest</code> that will pass in unit test mode, but the code being tested will fail in the post-GC insidious mode::</p>

<pre><code>@Test
public void nonStandardWriteMethodOnly() throws IntrospectionException {
    @SuppressWarnings(""unused"") class C {
        public C setFoo(String foo) { return this; }
    }

    BeanInfo bi = Introspector.getBeanInfo(C.class);
    ExtendedBeanInfo ebi = new ExtendedBeanInfo(bi);

    assertThat(hasReadMethodForProperty(bi, ""foo""), is(false));
    assertThat(hasWriteMethodForProperty(bi, ""foo""), is(false));

    assertThat(hasReadMethodForProperty(ebi, ""foo""), is(false));
    assertThat(hasWriteMethodForProperty(ebi, ""foo""), is(true));
}
</code></pre>

<p>One suggestion is that we can keep the current code working with the non-void setters by preventing the setter methods from being only softly reachable.  That seems like it would work, but that is rather a hack around the changed behavior in JDK 1.7.</p>

<p>Q: Is there some definitive specification stating that non-void setters should be anathema?  I've found nothing, and I currently consider this a bug in the JDK 1.7 libraries.

1                   electronics          0

<p>Now from the above flat data structure we want to show something like the below hierarchical tree structure . </p>

<pre><code> -Electronics

|   |   -21 inch
|   |   -23 inch
|   |   -lcd display

<pre><code>11                 Test               3
</code></pre>

<p>then it should show <code>Test</code> entry just below <code>21inch</code> .</p>

<p>So for this sort of thing I am currently using <code>ArrayList</code> and have been able to traverse till second level but can't do so for third level . So what is the perfect way for doing this ?</p>

",How to display flat data structure into hierarchical data structure (Java)?,<java><data-structures>,5,2,7,15998,1
26764532,12,"<p>I have a spring boot project that has a CrudRepository, an Entity and a Controller. I am basically trying to persist an entity based on the data passed to the Controller.</p>

<p>To do this, I am using <code>spring-boot-starter-jpa</code>. My Entity is annotated with JSR-303 annotations, which are checked in the controller <em>before</em> the data gets passed to the CrudRepository for persistence.</p>

<p>Controller method:</p>

<pre><code>@RequestMapping(value = ""users"", method = { RequestMethod.POST })
public SuccessfulResponse&lt;User&gt; addUser(@Valid @RequestBody User user, BindingResult validation) {
    if (validation.hasErrors()) {
        throw new ValidationException(validation);
    }
    User saved = this.users.save(user);
    return new SuccessfulResponse&lt;User&gt;(saved);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Entity:</p>

<pre><code>@Entity /* JPA */
public class User {

   @Id /* JPA */
   @Column(name=""email_address"", nullable=false, length=255) /* JPA */
   @UserUnique
   private String emailAddress;

}
</code></pre>

<p>The cause of my issues is the <code>UserUnique</code> annotation. Its validator looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class UserUniqueValidator implements ConstraintValidator&lt;UserUnique, String&gt; {

   private UserRepository users;

   @Autowired
   public UserUniqueValidator(UserRepository users) {
       this.users = users;
   }

   @Override
   public void initialize(UserUnique annotation) {}

   @Override
   public boolean isValid(String value, ConstraintValidatorContext context) {
       return users.findOne(value) == null;
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>What seems to be happening is, the validation is getting run twice. Once in the controller via the <code>@Valid</code> annotation, and once when Hibernate tries to persist the object. However, when Hibernate tries to persist the object, it throws:</p>

<pre><code>javax.validation.ValidationException: HV000064: Unable to instantiate ConstraintValidator: class test.UserUniqueValidator`
</code></pre>

<p>This seems to be because its not spring-aware and cant inject the dependency into the constructor. So, what I want to do is disable Hibernate validation completely (as its redundant and already happening in the controller).</p>

<p>There seems to be a property called <code>javax.persistence.validation.mode</code> which you can set to <code>none</code>. However, I cant for the life of me figure out where to set it in a code-based configuration.</p>

<p>I realise there are questions like <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2712345/jsr-303-dependency-injection-and-hibernate"">JSR-303 dependency injection and Hibernate</a> but these are all using xml config and manually configuring parts of the persistence layer.</p>

<p>What I want to do is ""post-configure"" the required parts of the persistence layer that Spring Boot creates for me because if I define my own then I am no longer leveraging Spring Boot's auto configuration. Can anyone help me determine if 1) this is possible and 2) which parts do I need to configure and how?</p>

<p>The default is 1/4 of your physical RAM (with upper &amp; lower limit); as a consequence, if you have a memory-hungry application you have to manually change the limit (parameter -Xmx), or your app will perform poorly, possible even crash with an OutOfMemoryError.</p>

<p>Why does this fixed limit even exist? Why does the JVM not allocate memory as needed, like native programs do on most operating systems?</p>

<p>This would solve a whole class of common problems with Java software (just google to see how many hints there are on the net on solving problems by setting -Xmx).</p>

<p><em>Edit:</em></p>

<p>Some answers point out that this will protect the rest of the system from a Java program with a run-away memory leak; without the limit this would bring the whole system down by exhausting all memory. This is true, however, it is equally true for any other program, and modern OSes already let you limit the maximum memory for a programm (Linux ulimit, Windows ""Job Objects""). So this does not really answer the question, which is ""Why does the JVM do it differently from most other programs / runtime environments?"".</p>

3362640,42,"<p>In Java there are a bunch of methods that all have to do with manipulating Strings.
The simplest example is the String.split(""something"") method.</p>

<p>Now the actual definition of many of those methods is that they all take a regular expression as their input parameter(s). Which makes then all very powerful building blocks.</p>

<p>Now there are two effects you'll see in many of those methods:</p>

<ol>
<li>They recompile the expression each time the method is invoked. As such they impose a performance impact.</li>
<li>I've found that in most ""real-life"" situations these methods are called with ""fixed"" texts. The most common usage of the split method is even worse: It's usually called with a single char (usually a ' ', a ';' or a '&amp;') to split by.</li>
</ol>

<p>So it's not only that the default methods are powerful, they also seem overpowered for what they are actually used for. Internally we've developed a ""fastSplit"" method that splits on fixed strings. I wrote a test at home to see how much faster I could do it if it was known to be a single char. Both are significantly faster than the ""standard"" split method.</p>

<p>So I was wondering: why was the Java API chosen the way it is now?
What was the good reason to go for this instead of having a something like   split(char) and split(String) and a splitRegex(String) ??</p>

<hr>

<p>Update: I slapped together a few calls to see how much time the various ways of splitting a string would take. </p>

<p>Short summary: It makes a <strong>big</strong> difference!</p>

<p>As you can see it makes a big difference if you have a lot of ""fixed char"" splits to do.</p>

<p>To give you guys some insight; I'm currently in the Apache logfiles and Hadoop arena with the data of a <em>big</em> website. So to me this stuff really matters :)</p>

<p>Something I haven't factored in here is the garbage collector. As far as I can tell compiling a regular expression into a Pattern/Matcher/.. will allocate a lot of objects, that need to be collected some time. So perhaps in the long run the differences between these versions is even bigger .... or smaller.</p>

<p>My conclusions so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>Only optimize this if you have a LOT of strings to split.</li>
<li>If you use the regex methods always precompile if you repeatedly use the same pattern.</li>
<li>Forget the (obsolete) StringTokenizer</li>
<li>If you want to split on a single char then use a custom method, especially if you only need to split it into a specific number of pieces (like ... 2).</li>
</ul>

5328,33,"<p>So, in Java, the first line of your constructor HAS to be a call to super... be it implicitly calling super(), or explicitly calling another constructor.  What I want to know is, why can't I put a try block around that?</p>

<p>My specific case is that I have a mock class for a test.  There is no default constructor, but I want one to make the tests simpler to read.  I also want to wrap the exceptions thrown from the constructor into a RuntimeException.</p>

<p>So, what I want to do is effectively this:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClassMock extends MyClass {
    public MyClassMock() {
        try {
            super(0);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }

    // Mocked methods
}
</code></pre>

<p>But Java complains that super isn't the first statement.</p>

<p>My workaround:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClassMock extends MyClass {
    public static MyClassMock construct() {
        try {
            return new MyClassMock();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }

    public MyClassMock() throws Exception {
        super(0);
    }

    // Mocked methods
}
</code></pre>

<p>Is this the best workaround?  Why doesn't Java let me do the former?</p>

<hr>

<p>My best guess as to the ""why"" is that Java doesn't want to let me have a constructed object in a potentially inconsistent state... however, in doing a mock, I don't care about that.  It seems I should be able to do the above... or at least I know that the above is safe for my case... or seems as though it should be anyways.</p>

<pre><code>org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormatter formatter = org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormat.forPattern(""dd-MMM-yyyy hh:mm:ss a Z"").withZone(DateTimeZone.UTC);

<p>The local time zone given is 5 hours and 30 minutes ahead of <code>UTC</code> / <code>GMT</code>. Therefore, the conversion to <code>UTC</code> should deduct 5 hours and 30 minutes from the date-time given which happens correctly using Joda Time. It displays the following output as expected.</p>

<pre><code>05-Jan-2016 09:34:44 AM +0000

<p>&#9658; The time zone offset <code>+0530</code> in place of <code>+05:30</code> has been taken because it is dependent upon <code>&lt;p:calendar&gt;</code> which submits a zone offset in this format.

<p>Conversion from a local time zone whose offset is <code>+05:30</code> to <code>UTC</code> and then conversion from <code>UTC</code> back to that time zone must obviously redisplay the same date-time as inputted through the calendar component which is the rudimentary functionality of the converter given.</p>

<p>The API suggests that overriding <code>FutureTask.setException()</code> should help in this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Causes this future to report an ExecutionException  with the given throwable as its cause, unless this Future has already been set or has been cancelled. This method is invoked internally by the run method upon failure of the computation. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>However this method doesn't seem to be called (running with the debugger shows the exception is caught by <code>FutureTask</code>, but <code>setException</code> isn't called). I've written the following program to reproduce my problem:</p>

<pre><code>public class RunTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyFutureTask t = new MyFutureTask(new Runnable() {

            @Override
            public void run() {
                throw new RuntimeException(""Unchecked exception"");

            }
        });

        ExecutorService service = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
        service.submit(t);
    }
}

public class MyFutureTask extends FutureTask&lt;Object&gt; {

    public MyFutureTask(Runnable r) {

        super.setException(t);
        System.out.println(""Exception: "" + t);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Still pretty new to mongo db but I'm trying to update part of an existing document inside a collection... unfortunately, the link above doesn't have an update example.</p>

<p>Essentially, i just want to be able to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Add new fields to a document </li>
<li>Update existing fields of a document
to a new value</li>
</ol>

<p>Here's my code (Grails + Groovy + Java + MongoDB + the java driver):</p>

<pre><code>def shape = mongo.shapes.findOne(new BasicDBObject(""data"", ""http://www.foo.com"")); // get the document
mongo.shapes.update(new BasicDBObject(""_id"", shape._id), new BasicDBObject(""isProcessed"", 0));  // add a new ""isProcessed"" field set to 0
mongo.shapes.update(new BasicDBObject(""_id"", shape._id), new BasicDBObject(""data"", ""http://www.bar.com""));
</code></pre>

<p>This pretty much clobbers the entire object... I might try just modifying the original shape object and then running the update on that.  But until then, <strong>does anyone have experience updating just individual fields (rather than the entire document)?</strong></p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I just tried it and was able to successfully update by sending the entire object across with new and/or updated fields and that works.  I wonder if the driver is smart enough to only update the smallest subset of changes or if it's just blindly updating the entire thing? (In  the case below, is it just updating the foo field across the wire or the entire shape document?)</p>

<p>Code:</p>

<pre><code>def shape = mongo.shapes.findOne(); // get the first shape to use as a base
shape.removeField(""_id"");  // remove the id field
shape.put(""foo"",""bar"");  // add a new field ""foo""
mongo.shapes.insert(shape);  // insert the new shape
def shape2 = mongo.shapes.findOne(new BasicDBObject(""foo"", ""bar""));  // get the newly inserted shape (and more importantly, it's id)
shape2.put(""foo"", ""bat"");  // update the ""foo"" field to a new value
mongo.shapes.update(new BasicDBObject(""_id"", shape2._id), shape2);  // update the existing document in mongo

<p>From the stack trace, it looks like setting the StringBuilder's length results in <code>Arrays.fill</code> being called. However, I don't understand why this is happening because the StringBuilder's length is set to <strong>zero</strong>.</p>

<p>Looking at the code for Log4j's <code>RingBufferLogEvent.getMessageTextForWriting</code> method, it is clear the StringBuilder's length is never set to any other value than zero:</p>

<pre><code>// RingBufferLogEvent.java

private StringBuilder getMessageTextForWriting() {
    if (messageText == null) {
        messageText = new StringBuilder(Constants.INITIAL_REUSABLE_MESSAGE_SIZE); // 128
    }
    messageText.setLength(0); // &lt;-- this call. Note: new length is ALWAYS zero.
    return messageText;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I don't understand how this could ever result in <code>Arrays.fill</code> being invoked. Looking at the code for <code>AbstractStringBuilder</code>, <code>Arrays.fill</code> should only be invoked if the new length is <em>greater than</em> the previous number of characters used.</p>

<pre><code>// AbstractStringBuilder.java

public void setLength(int newLength) {
    if (newLength &lt; 0)
        throw new StringIndexOutOfBoundsException(newLength);
    ensureCapacityInternal(newLength);

    if (count &lt; newLength) { // &lt;-- how can this condition be true if newLength is zero?
        Arrays.fill(value, count, newLength, '\0');
    }

    count = newLength;
}

<p>This kind of bean has some complications:</p>

<li><code>Path</code> is an interface, and <code>Path</code> objects should be created using the <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/Paths.html#get%28java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String...%29"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>Paths.get(String...)</code></a> static factory method.</li>

<p>I need to indicate the static factory method to use, which would seem to require a <code>factory-method</code> attribute.

    factory-method=""java.nio.file.Paths.get""/&gt;

<p>Lastly, I need to give the arguments for the factory method. How do I do that? Using nested <code>constructor-arg</code> (sic) elements? So, something like this?</p>

24594541,13,"<p>Thank you for your help in advanced. And sorry if this is a very silly question, but I cannot find it elsewhere. 
What I want, is basically, to determine the total amount of pages I have in my ViewPager when it is all set up, like in my code. I have tried (on a later version) adding the ""size variable"" to f as it's argument (see, FirstFragment). It's not a known number, as the user input's the number of forms (view's) I will create, and passes it to FirstFragment as an intent. So I have tried :                                       </p>

<pre><code>Fragment f = new UserFragment();
Bundle bundl = new Bundle();
bundl.putInt(""pagenumbers"", size);
f.setArguments(bundl);
lf.add(f); 
</code></pre>

<p>Inside FirstFragment. But when UserFragment extracts its arguments under ""pagenumbers"" it is returning 0. 
I then tried to gain access to the getCount() method that lives inside FragmentAdapter, however, I'm not sure how to go about this, given that I'm inside UserFragment when I need it.</p>

<p>What I'm trying to do maybe to help clarify, is I'm extracting ""current page info"" which I now have working thanks to an earlier post of mine and those whom helped. Now I want to see if ""currentpage == size (//which is number of pages. Total views in the viewpager)"". So in the onClick method you can see in UserFragment, if it's the last page, and the user hits the button to go to the next page. I want it to jump to another activity, where it manipulates all the SparseArray data that was collected from all the forms. (Which I need help on how to put this SparseArray data into an intent, I will probably make a new question with this ... as it's not very related). So if you could either assist me in getting my current attempts to work (how to do it properly) or just suggest an entirely new method I'm happy. As long as I can get it working!</p>

<p>Thank you very much for all your assistance, in advanced. Please help! </p>

32931030,10,"<p>In his book <em>Effective Java</em>, Joshua Bloch writes about the pitfalls that occur with the contract of <code>equals()</code> when derived classes add additional fields to the check. Normally, this would break the symmetry, but Bloch states that ""you <em>can</em> add a value component to a subclass of an <em>abstract</em> class without violating the equals contract"".</p>

<p>Obviously this is true because there can be no instances of the abstract class, so there is no symmetry to violate. But what about other subclasses? I wrote this example, intentionally omitting hashcode implementations and null-checks to keep the code short:</p>



<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>public abstract class Vehicle {

    private final String color;

    public Vehicle(String color) {
        this.color = color;
    }

    public String getColor() {
        return color;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) return true;

        if (!(o instanceof Vehicle)) return false;

        Vehicle that = (Vehicle) o;

        return color.equals(that.color);
    }

}

public class Bicycle extends Vehicle {

    public Bicycle(String color) {
        super(color);
    }

}

public class Car extends Vehicle {

    private final String model;

    public Car(String color, String model) {
        super(color);
        this.model = model;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) return true;

        if (!(o instanceof Car)) return false;

        Car that = (Car) o;

        return getColor().equals(that.getColor()) &amp;&amp; model.equals(that.model);
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>When I create one instance of each class with the same color string, the symmetry of <code>equals()</code> is broken:</p>

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>Bicycle bicycle = new Bicycle(""blue"");
Car car = new Car(""blue"", ""Mercedes"");

bicycle.equals(car) &lt;- true
car.equals(bicycle) &lt;- false
</code></pre>

<p>I am unsure on how to handle this the best way. Declare <code>equals()</code> as abstract in the abstract class to enforce an implementation in the subclasses? But the same effect could be achieved by not declaring <code>equals ()</code> at all in the abstract class.</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;context:property-placeholder location=""classpath:myConfigFile.properties"" /&gt;

<p>and it worked great. But now we want to load properties from a specific file on the system that is NOT in the classpath. We wanted to be able to dynamically load the file, so we are using a Java environment variable to populate it. I'll give a simple example below:</p>

<p>In Java:</p>

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>  System.setProperty(""my.prop.file"", ""/path/to/myConfigFile.properties"");
</code></pre>

<p>In Spring XML:</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;context:property-placeholder location=""${my.prop.file}"" /&gt;

<p>I've also tried it this way, thanks to an idea from Luciano:</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;context:property-placeholder properties-ref=""prop"" /&gt;

&lt;util:properties id=""prop"" location=""reso""/&gt;

&lt;bean id=""reso"" class=""org.springframework.core.io.FileSystemResource""&gt;

&lt;context:property-placeholder location=""file:/path/to/myConfigFile.properties"" /&gt;

&lt;context:property-placeholder location=""file:///path/to/myConfigFile.properties"" /&gt;

<p>How do you use property-placeholders with a location that is on the file system and NOT on the classpath? We are using Spring 3.0.5.</p>

I am a CS undergrad who has have been using Java for 3 years, and I still find it difficult to comprehend how to include the Main function into my design. It feels wrong to place it in a class all on its own, but it also feels wrong to insert it into another class file. I see the latter as such because it doesn't fit in with the rest of the class making it incohesive. I can't just stick a main function on my DocumentReader object, for example. It would have nothing to do with the object. On the other hand, I can't just make a Main class that only has a main function inside it because in object-oriented programming, you're supposed to think in terms of objects effectively creating a miniature world in your head. For that miniature world to revolve around a single object that does nothing but exist just seems off. It doesn't act as a narrator and character in a story because it does nothing, at the same time. I prefer C's style of having a Main function that is separate from everything. It keeps the narrative of the story separate from the characters that are interacting with one another.</p>

<p>This question really only applies to an Applet I've made. It contains one Class, and requires 2 other Jar libraries. I've included these in the projects (multiple projects, because I've tried this in Netbeans and Eclipse...it's easy to recreate a one Class project). The point of all this is that my HTML/web project shouldn't have to deal with more than one Jar or reference them. It's not a complicated applet/project at all either.</p>

<p>Originally, I made it in Netbeans. It has the main package, and after adding the 2 Jars, they are put in a ""Libraries"" area (the ""resources"" folder). After building it, Netbeans creates a Jar for my one package/class, and then puts the 2 other libraries in a ""lib"" directory next to it. I'd like them to be in one, distributable Jar. From the many things I've looked through, I've tried putting the following in build.xml:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;target name=""YourBigJar"" depends=""-post-jar""&gt;
  &lt;jar destfile=""dist/BigJar.jar""&gt;
    &lt;zipfileset src=""dist/cxapplet.jar""/&gt;
    &lt;zipfileset src=""resources/dpotapi.jar""/&gt;
    &lt;zipfileset src=""resources/dpotjni.jar""/&gt;
  &lt;/jar&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But it produces nothing. I got this from <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2212913/netbeans-deploying-all-in-one-jar"">NetBeans - deploying all in one jar</a> . I don't know/understand how to use build.xml, so I wouldn't be surprised if something's going wrong (obviously), but I get no error/warning messages.</p>

<p>When I made it in Eclipse, it effectively combines them, but when I use the Jar in my actual web project, it says it cannot find the classes from the other 2 Jars. I wouldn't understand how to fix it, but is it a Classpath problem? In Eclipse, I make a new directory called ""lib"" and put the Jars in it. Then, I right-click the project, go to ""Java Build Path"", and add the Jars, also checking them under the ""Order and Export"" tab. From things I've read, I right-click the project, choose ""Export"", choose ""Jar"", uncheck the "".classpath"" and "".project"" files, only check ""Export generated class files and resources"", and then allow it to generate the manifest file. Like I said, this generates one Jar, but its contents are my package and then a ""lib"" directory that has the 2 other Jars. The Manifest is there, but it's pretty empty and doesn't reference any files (not sure if that's important). When I put it in my web app, it says the applet can't find the other classes.</p>

<p>It just seems so simple - one package/class, two external Jars...combine into one Jar when built for distribution as an applet. Any ideas?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>Since we started using Maven, someone looked into using a Maven plugin. So we ended up creating a new project to house the applet (since it's used across multiple projects), and used this in our <code>pom.xml</code>, in the end:</p>

<p>I would expect <code>T</code> to be inferred to <code>B</code>. <code>A</code> does not extend <code>B</code>. So why doesn't the compiler complain about it?</p>

<p><code>T</code> seems to be inferred to <code>Object</code>, since I can pass a <code>Generic&lt;Object&gt;</code> as well.</p>

<p>Moreover, <strong>when actually running the code</strong>, it throws an <code>ArrayStoreException</code> on the <code>a[0] = b.get();</code> line.</p>

<p>I'm not using any raw generic types. I feel like this exception could have been avoided with a compile time error, or at least a warning, if <code>T</code> was actually inferred to be <code>B</code>.</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {

}

public static &lt;T&gt; void fList(List&lt;T&gt; a, Generic&lt;? extends T&gt; b) {

40439872,9,"<p>I need to implement an enum to enum converter in java: <code>Enum_2</code> > <code>Enum_1</code> and I'd like to do it in generic way.</p>

<p>So I defined an interface:</p>

<pre><code>interface LabelAware&lt;T extends Enum&gt; {
    String getLabel();

    T getObject();
}
</code></pre>

<p>and <code>Enum_1</code>: </p>

<pre><code>enum Enum_1 {
    A, B;

    String getValue() {
        return ""whatever"";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and <code>Enum_2</code> which implements <code>LabelAware</code> and needs to be converted to <code>Enum_1</code>:</p>

<pre><code>enum Enum_2 implements LabelAware&lt;Enum_1&gt; {
    C(""c"", Enum_1.A), D(""d"", Enum_1.B);

    private final String label;
    private final Enum_1 object;

    Enum_2(String label, Enum_1 object) {
        this.label = label;
        this.object = object;
    }

    public String getLabel() {
        return label;
    }

    public Enum_1 getObject() {
        return object;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, here's a generic converter (<code>List.ofAll()</code> comes from <a href=""http://www.javaslang.io/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">javaslang</a>):</p>

<pre><code>class Converter&lt;S extends LabelAware, D extends Enum&gt; {

    private S[] values;

    Converter(S[] values) {
        this.values = values;
    }

    D map(String label) {
        return (D) List.of(values)
                .find(v -&gt; v.getLabel().equals(label))
                .map(LabelAware::getObject)
                .getOrElseThrow(() -&gt; new RuntimeException(""""));
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And a main method:</p>

<pre><code>public class Main {

      System.out.println(new Converter&lt;Enum_2, Enum_1&gt;(Enum_2.values()).map(""c"").getValue());
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>It all compiles and runs well, however I've no idea why I need to cast the result of <code>Converter.map</code> method to <code>D</code>, since I've declared <code>D</code> to extend <code>Enum</code>. Can it be done in a generic way without any warnings?</p>

<p>I've tried using <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/awt/KeyboardFocusManager.html""><code>KeyboardFocusManager</code></a> to listen for input focus changes, and then calling <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/JComponent.html#scrollRectToVisible%28java.awt.Rectangle%29""><code>scrollRectToVisible</code></a>.</p>

        JFrame window = new JFrame(""Follow focus"");
        window.setContentPane(new JScrollPane(content));

<p>If you run this example, you'll notice it doesn't work very well. It does get the focus change notifications, but the call to <code>scrollRectToVisible</code> doesn't appear to have any effect. In my app (which is too complex to show here), <code>scrollRectToVisible</code> works about half the time when I tab into something outside of the viewport.</p>

<p>Is there an established way to solve this problem? If it makes any difference, the Swing app is built on Netbeans RCP (and most of our customers run Windows).</p>

16444672,8,"<p>I am developing a space combat game in Java as part of an ongoing effort to learn the language. In a battle, I have <em>k</em> ships firing their guns at a fleet of <em>n</em> of their nefarious enemies. Depending on how many of their enemies get hit by how many of the shots, (each ship fires one shot which hits one enemy), some will be damaged and some destroyed. I want to figure out how many enemies were hit once, how many were hit twice and so on, so that at the end I have a table that looks something like this, for 100 shots fired:</p>

<pre><code>Number of hits | Number of occurences | Total shots
----------------------------------------------------
       1       |        30            |      30

<p>Obviously, I can brute force this for small numbers of shots and enemies by randomly placing each shot on an enemy and then counting how many times each got shot at the end. This method, however, will be very impractical if I've got three million intrepid heroes firing on a swarm of ten million enemies.</p>

<p>Ideally, what I'd like is a way to generate a distribution of how many enemies are likely to be hit by exactly some number of shots. I could then use a random number generator to pick a point on that distribution, and then repeat this process, increasing the number of hits each time, until approximately all shots are accounted for. Is there a general statistical distribution / way of estimating approximately how many enemies get hit by how many shots?</p>

<p>I've been trying to work out something from the birthday problem to figure out the probability of how many birthdays are shared by exactly some number of people, but have not made any significant progress.</p>

<p>I will be implementing this in Java.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I found a simplification of this that may be easier to solve: what's the distribution of probabilities that <em>n</em> enemies are not hit at all? I.e. whats the probability that zero are not hit, one is not hit, two are not hit, etc. </p>

<p>It's a similar problem, (ok, the same problem but with a simplification), but seems like it might be easier to solve, and would let me generate the full distribution in a couple of iterations.</p>

<p>It seems that the change was introduced in <a href=""http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8/jdk/diff/d62c911aebbb/src/share/classes/java/util/HashMap.java#l1.2459"" rel=""nofollow"">this commit</a>.

Substance absolutely refuses to construct UI classes outside of the EDT. I've done plenty of Swing/AWT and I know most of the rules regarding the EDT. I use SwingWorker, SwingUtilties.invokeLater to modify components. I always though that components could be <strong><em>CONSTRUCTED</em></strong> outside of the EDT, but must be <strong><em>realized</em></strong> and <strong><em>manipulated</em></strong> on the EDT. In other words, you can construct and setup defaults in the background but the call to pack/setVisible must be EDT as well as any subsequent calls to manipulate the component.</p>

<p>The reason I ask is that I have a particularly ""beefy"" window to construct, involving many widgets, state, and resources (lots of icons). Previously, I constructed the window on the background method of a SwingWorker and made the window visible in the done method. Never had a single problem. Upon switching to Substance, the internal EDT checking bites me.</p>

<p>I've been able to refactor code to get around this. I can construct on the EDT which isn't a good solution since the entire application will block. I can also refactor even more and try my best to load all of the extra resources outside of the EDT.</p>

8521978,8,"<p>So I'm encountering a problem in my Spring app. The user can enter dates using a date picker tool and these are stored in a Mysql database using Hibernate. The table uses a Date field to store them so it's not saving times. The problem is that the server is set to GMT and our users are EST or GMT-5. So the date gets correctly stored in the database, but then when it's displayed on the front end it always shows the previous date. Annoys me since I'm not saving the time but obviously it's still affecting things. Anyway, so 12/10/2001 would show up on the front end as 12/09/2011. I've looked into it and I'm not permitted to change the server to EST so I'm now looking into solving this with Jodatime (unless someone has an idea that I'm doing something else to cause this) or an easier solution.</p>

<p>My problem is that I can't find any good info on how to use Jodatime with Spring. Currently I'm just trying to change one object over from using java's <code>Date</code> to using joda's <code>LocalDate</code>. No matter what I try though I'm getting errors on ""invalid stream header"" and ""could not deserialize"" when it tries to pull the date object from the database and shove it into the <code>LocalDate</code> object. </p>

<p>Could someone provide me with some guidance on what I need to do for both storing and retrieving so that this works? </p>

<p>I'm using Spring 3.1 with annotations and all that good stuff. I'm happy to provide code but since I'm not sure what do to I don't really have any code that I think would be helpful. I could really use some help on the whole thing from the JSPs to the Database and back. I think the main thing I'm not sure of is how to store this on the server and I think that's why I'm getting Hibernate errors. The database is using Date as I mentioned, so not storing time. How do I convert a LocalDate into this?</p>

<p>Here is some code if it helps:</p>

<p><strong>Domain Object</strong></p>

<pre><code>@Entity
public class Provision {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    private LocalDate startDate;

    //Getters and setters
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have a <strong>DatePropertyEditor</strong> for converting from text to Date between JSP and Spring:</p>

<pre><code>public class DatePropertyEditor extends PropertyEditorSupport {
@Override
public void setAsText(String value) {
    try {
        setValue(new SimpleDateFormat(""yyyy-MM-dd"").parse(value));
    } catch (ParseException e) {
        setValue(null);
    }
}

@Override
public String getAsText() {
    if(getValue() != null)
        return new SimpleDateFormat(""yyyy-MM-dd"").format((Date) getValue());
    else
        return null;
}

}
</code></pre>

<p>And here is some of the JSP where data is entered:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;td align=""right""&gt;Start Date:&lt;/td&gt;

16657479,16,"<p>Our legacy app is stuck with a terrible framework (okay, I'll name names, it's Tapestry 4) that involves a ridiculous number of <code>EventListeners</code> (~100,000) for the simplest operations. I'm guessing this is beyond what <code>javax.swing.event.EventListenerList</code> was ever meant to handle, and in this unfortunate use case it's causing us some nasty performance headaches.</p>

<p>I spent a couple of hours whipping up the fairly naive <code>HashMap/ArrayList</code>-based replacement below, and it's massively faster in almost every way:</p>

<p>Add 50,000 listeners:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>EventListenerList</code> > 2 seconds</li>
<li><code>EventListenerMap</code> ~ 3.5 milliseconds</li>
</ul>

<p>Fire event to 50,000 listeners:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>EventListenerList</code> 0.3-0.5 milliseconds</li>
<li><code>EventListenerMap</code> 0.4-0.5 milliseconds</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><code>EventListenerList</code> > 2 seconds</li>
<li><code>EventListenerMap</code> ~280 milliseconds</li>
</ul>

<p>Firing might be just a hair slower, but modification is enormously faster. Admittedly, the situation this framework has put us in is pathological, but it still seems like <code>EventListenerList</code> could have been replaced a long time ago.

<p>The interface looks like this currently:</p>

<pre><code>public interface TransformUtilsBase&lt;T&gt; {

    Class&lt;?&gt; transformToNhin(T request, BrokerContext brokerContext);
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the impl I <em>know</em> what the return type should be. At the interface level there is no way to tell.</p>

<p>I could just forego an interface all together, and just make several classes all with the same method names, but I wanted to formalize it, since they are all getting used for the same purpose. Only the types are different.</p>

<p>Or I could just have one big class of static methods since they are util operations, but it was becoming unwieldy to manage a class with so many methods with the same name, and all the necessary helper methods (again all with the same name).</p>

<p>Implementing an interface seems like the best option to formalize functionality, even though I'm not able to do static methods. I just can't figure out how to deal with the return types.</p>

My system needs to pass both types of messages to numerous business logic threads.  Reducing latency is very important so I am investigating using a Disruptor to pass messages from the main thread to the business logic threads in a mechanically sympathetic manner.</p>

<p>My problem is that the disruptor only accepts one type of object in the ring buffer.  This makes sense because the disruptor pre-allocates the objects in the ring buffer.

In this case,  the main thread must encode the messages into byte arrays before publishing them to the disruptor and each of the business logic threads must decode the byte arrays back into objects upon receipt.  The downside of this setup is that the business logic threads are not truly sharing the memory from the disruptor - instead they are creating new objects (and thus creating garbage) from the byte array provided by the disruptor. The upside of this setup is that all business logic threads can read multiple different types of messages from the same disruptor.</p></li>
<li><p>Configure the disruptor to use a single type of object but create <strong>multiple disruptors</strong>, one for for each object type.  In the case above, there would be two separate disruptors - one for objects of type A and another for objects of type B.  The upside of this setup is that the main thread doesn't have to encode the object to a byte array and the business less logic threads can share the same objects as used in the disruptor (no garbage created).  The downside of this setup is that somehow each business logic thread will have to subscribe to messages from multiple disruptors.</p></li>
<li><p>Configure the disruptor to use a single type of <strong>""super"" object</strong> that contains all fields of both message A and B.  This is very against OO style, but will allow for a compromise between option #1 and #2.</p></li>
<li><p>Configure the disruptor to use <strong>object references</strong>.  However, in this case I lose the performance benefits of object preallocation and memory ordering.</p></li>

<pre><code>someObject = someObject.&amp;helloWorld
</code></pre>

<p>Then, I can do these without referring to the object and method name:</p>

<pre><code> someObject() 
 someObject(""Hello World"")
 someObject(""Hello"", ""World"") 
</code></pre>

<p>How can I bind the method reference like this at the 'template.bind(map)' stage along with auto-resolving all the parameter combinations like the '.&amp;' operator in the script provides?</p>

<p>But that defeats the purpose. In that case I might as well just bind the object instead of 'testMethod' and use it normally in Groovy template with regular method calls. So that is not the solution here. </p>

<p>The solution will create a binding such that testMethod() can be called just like this, and resolved for all overloaded methods, just like the ""mc1=testInstance.&amp;test"" provides. </p>

<p><strong>The mc1 is a MethodClosure and 'mc1=testInstance.&amp;test' does some magic that I want to do that magic at the binding stage!</strong></p>

<p>The metaclass of mc1 is a 'HandleMetaClass'. I can also custom set the metaclass of the methodclosure from the Java side. I just want to know how to do that to get the same behaviour. The Groovy is doing that in the template (from Java side in the template interpreter) and so I want to do it the same, in advance.</p>

<p>Note that normally, the streaming template creates its own delegate already. When the template code 'def mc1=testInstance.&test;' is interpreted, the Groovy compiler/interpreter uses that delegate when creating the MethodClosure with a HandleMetaClass, and then installs that in the existing delegate.</p>

<p>The proper answer then <strong>does not install a replacement delegate</strong> as per @Dany answer below, <strong>but instead works with the existing delegate and creates the correct objects to facilitate usage</strong> of mc1 without the '.call' syntax.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> As Michael Borgwardt stated in the comments, the problem is not the line wrap, but the row height: JTables rows are fixed size, so if a cell is getting higher (cause the text is now multi-lined), we have to increase the row height.
But how much? I will check if this is worth another SO-question. If not, I will add this solution here.</p>

<p>In my Eclipse Juno installation (updated to latest), this is my JDT Core JAR file: <code>org.eclipse.jdt.core_3.8.3.v20130121-145325.jar</code>.  I tried to build on this tag (<code>v20130121-145325</code>), but I get a similar error.</p>

In there, the Exception gets thrown (inside <code>ContextFactor.createContext(String ClassLoader, Map)</code>), but I can't see what's going on because the source isn't here.</p>

<p>I have an class FileItems. FileItems constructor takes a file, and throws an exception (FileNotFoundException) if the file doesn't exist. Other methods of that class also involve file operations and thus have the ability throw the FileNotFoundException. I would like to find a better solution. A solution which doesn't require that other programmers handle all of these extremely unlikely FileNotFoundExceptions.</p>

<p>The facts of the matter:</p>

<ol>
<li>The file has been checked to exist but the extremely unlikely possibility exists that through some major fault of reality the file might be deleted before this method is called.</li>
<li>Since the probability of 1 happening is extremely unlike and unrecoverable, I would prefer to define an unchecked exception.</li>
<li>The file is has already been found to exist, forcing other programmers to write code and catch the checked FileNotFoundException seems tedious and useless. The program should just fail completely at that point. For example there is always the chance that a computer may <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lp0_on_fire"" rel=""noreferrer"">catch fire, but no one is insane enough to force other programmers to handle that as a checked exception</a>.</li>
<li>I run into this sort of Exception issue from time to time, and defining custom unchecked exceptions each time I encounter this problem (my old solution) is tiresome and adds to code-bloat.</li>
</ol>

<p>The code currently looks like this</p>

<pre><code> public Iterator getFileItemsIterator() {
    try{
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(this.fileWhichIsKnowToExist);
        return new specialFileItemsIterator(sc);        
       } catch (FileNotFoundException e){ //can never happen} 

    return null;
 }

<p>How one should configure <code>ActiveMQ</code> and <code>&lt;flow&gt;</code> in <code>Mule ESB 3.2</code>, in order to make sure that message pulled from queue ends up properly handled by external <code>CXF service</code>?</p>

<p><strong>Scenario</strong></p>

<p>I have an CXF endpoint, which should take incoming message and transfer it to three external services as soon as possible. Let's call them EX1, EX2, EX3. This is fairly easy, thanks to the <code>&lt;all&gt;</code> component introduced in Mule 3.x.</p>

<p><strong>The most important requirement</strong> of the whole solution, is to make sure that each received message ends up being delivered to all three CXF services. So we ended up with the idea, to put each incoming message into <code>Persistent JMS queues</code> (Q1, Q2, Q3). After message is being read from queue Qn, it's transfered directly to corresponding EXn endpoint, and thus - external service.</p>

<p><strong>Config</strong></p>

<p>(I can provide full config upon request)</p>

<p>We have configured ActiveMQ broker as described <a href=""http://www.mulesoft.org/mule-activemq-integration-examples"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a> and wired it up with our <code>&lt;flow&gt;</code> config. Everything seems to work as expected, I have JConsole connected to my application so I can see that messages are of type PERSISTENT and they end up in proper queues. If everything goes smoothly - messages are received by all three services EXn.</p>

<p><strong>Tests</strong></p>

<p>The problem arrises when we turn off one of the services, let's say EX2, and restart the whole server simulating failure. <strong>The message ends up being lost</strong> (I guess it's not that persistent, huh?). 
The most curious thing is - If we sent 10 messages when the EX2 is down, after server restart 9 of them are being properly redelivered! So I'm thinking that maybe, just maybe, 9 of those 10 messages were properly enqueued, while the one was being constantly redelivered when the server failed down.</p>

<p>This causes me to think, that CXF endpoint is not being handled with transaction support, which I cannot understand, to be honest. After all I can see the message being in the queue when it's trying to be redelivered, so it should be persisted. It's clearly not, but why?</p>

<p><strong>My own attempts</strong>
I have tried a number of things, none of which have worked. Always one message gets lost.</p>

<ol>
<li>Not to use any <code>&lt;jms:transaction /&gt;</code> tags within the flows - didn't work</li>
<li>Starting jms transaction upon message receive, joining while sending to <code>&lt;cxf:jaxws-client /&gt;</code></li>
<li>Using XA with JBoss and <code>&lt;xa-transaction /&gt;</code> - didn't work</li>
<li>Providing <code>&lt;default-exception-strategy&gt;</code> config - If I recall it made things worst</li>
</ol>

<p>Any help is appreciated, thanks.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>That is a small part of my content provider. So my questions are: </p>

<p>1) How do I implement a rawQuery() in my content provider? or how do I use properly my queryBuilder?, let's say I want to execute this query using several tables, renaming them and also passing the p1.id as a parameter? </p>

<pre><code>SELECT p1.first_name, p1_last_name 
FROM Person p1, Person P2, Relationship r 
WHERE p1.id = ? AND 
      p1.id = r.relative_id AND
      p2.id = r.related_id;
</code></pre>

<p>I tried so by doing this: On my query() method (shown above) I have a new case, called GET_RELATIVES: </p>

<pre><code>case GET_RELATIVES:
        db = dbHelper.getWritableDatabase();
        queryBuilder.setTables(PersonModel.TABLE_PERSON + "" p1, ""
                + PersonModel.TABLE_PERSON + "" p2, ""
                + RelationshipModel.TABLE_RELATIONSHIP + "" r"");
        queryBuilder.appendWhere(""p2.""+PersonModel.C_ID + ""="" + uri.getLastPathSegment());
        queryBuilder.appendWhere(""p2.""+PersonModel.C_ID + ""="" + ""r.related_id"");
        queryBuilder.appendWhere(""p1.""+PersonModel.C_ID + ""="" + ""r.relative_id"");
</code></pre>

<p>so I defined a new PATH, CONTENT URI and add it to the UriMatcher, like this: </p>

<pre><code>private static final String PATH_GET_RELATIVES = ""get_relatives"";
public static final Uri CONTENT_URI_GET_RELATIVES = Uri
        .parse(""content://"" + AUTHORITY + ""/""
                + PATH_GET_RELATIVES);
private static final int GET_RELATIVES = 22;

private static final UriMatcher sURIMatcher = new UriMatcher(
    UriMatcher.NO_MATCH);
static {
...
sURIMatcher.addURI(AUTHORITY, PATH_GET_RELATIVES, GET_RELATIVES);
}
</code></pre>

<p>but this does not seem to work so I think I'm probably defining something wrong on my content provider or inside the query method.</p>

<p>2) I am not quite sure what is the point on having for each table a constant called TABLE_ID and adding it to the switch-case. What is that used for? How do I call it?  </p>

<p>Hope anyone can help me with this, thanks in advance!    </p>

The biggest annoyance I've run across with Jersey 2 is that it uses HK2, which for some reason repackages standard Maven artifacts.  To avoid potential annoying-to-debug issues, I try to avoid pulling in the same classes from different projects.  I use the <a href=""http://mojo.codehaus.org/extra-enforcer-rules/banDuplicateClasses.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ban Duplicate Classes</a> Maven enforcer rules from the Extra Enforcer Rules dependency to break the build if this occurs.</p>

<p>According to the aforementioned Ban Duplicate Classes enforcer rule, switching to Jersey 2 has introduced the following conflicts between its artifacts and standard ones I was previously using:</p>

<p>My solution has been to exclude the standard artifacts from the dependencies that transitively pull them, and therefore use only the hk2 artifacts. I figure this is safer: I don't know what else the hk2 artifacts are pulling in that I might be missing if I were to exclude them instead (for example, the bean-validator artifact appears to be repackaging at least four artifacts).  The  downsides to this are that first, I a ton of exclusions peppering my dependencies that were bringing in otherwise innocuous API dependencies, such as validation-api.  Secondly, my artifacts are now exporting HK2 repackaged dependencies, rather than the actual API classes I would prefer to be exporting.</p>

<p>Ultimately, my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Why does HK2 repackage everything?  Is there some good reason for this?</li>
<li>What is HK2 actually repackaging, and can I just use the standard API versions instead? How would I figure this out? I've cloned the HK2 project, and I've had a bit of trouble figuring out where to begin to find this out.</li>
</ol>

<p>Barring the actual answer to these questions, what would be a good forum for contacting the developers behind HK2 so I can ask the question directly?

1348603,101,"<p>I'm working on a fairly big Maven project.  We have probably around 70 or so individual artifacts, which are roughly split into two libraries of shared code and maybe ten applications which use them.  All of these items live in the namespace <code>com.mycompany.*</code>.</p>

<p>Most of the time we're running against snapshot builds.  So to do a full build of an application, I might first build the library projects so that they are installed to my local repository (as, say, <code>mycompany-libname-2.4-SNAPSHOT.jar</code>).</p>

<p>The problem is that when I then go build the applications.  For some reason, Maven wants to check the main two public repositories (maven-net-repo and java-net-repo) for updates for all of the <code>mycompany-*-SNAPSHOT.jar</code> artifacts.  Of course, they aren't found there, and everything eventually resolves back to the versions I just built to my local repository, but I'd like Maven to stop doing this because (a) it makes me feel like a bad net.citizen for constantly checking these repositories for things that will never be there, and (b) it adds some unnecessary and annoying network latency into my build process.</p>

<p>I've taken to running maven in offline mode most of the time to work around this, but that's not ideal since occasionally a dependency on a public library will be updated.  So what I'm looking for is a solution which will cause Maven not to check for updates from given repositories for artifacts which meet certain criteria - in this case, I'd be happy if Maven would ignore either SNAPSHOT versions or artifacts which were in the <code>com.mycompany</code> namespace.</p>

<p>Typically, the processing time for this is really quick. </p>

<p>However, we need to embed an image within a template.  We've been embedding these as JPEG images using Word's ""Insert/Picture/From File..."" functionality. But we've found that the resultant RTF file size is massively dependant upon the image. </p>

<p>For example, I've inserted a 20k JPEG logo (which is basically a solid background with some text). The RTF file increased in size from around 390k (without the image) to 510k (with the image).</p>

<p>Then we inserted a JPEG containing a screenshot, i.e. the image contains text, multiple colours, etc. The JPEG is around 150k. Using this image, the RTF file increased in size from 390k to 3.5MB.</p>

<p>So the encoding that Word uses for storing images into an RTF doesn't perform linearly. I'm guessing it is dependant upon what is in the JPEG image.</p>

<p>I need to keep the size of the RTF templates to a minimum to try and keep our file processing times to a minimum.</p>

<li>Does anyone have any ideas on how to minimize the size of the RTF files with embedded images?  </li>

<p>As far as I have googled it, the issue is that the firefox driver that selenium uses is incompatible with the version of the browser. Having in mind the frequent updates firefox releases, it will be difficult to maintain my local test environment. </p>

<p>So, I am not sure how to setup my selenium configuration in order to make it work with the static firefox. Probably I must configure my app to receive the path to the firefox binary for the driver to use? I'd like to know if anything else is also needed.</p>

<p>Now, within my ""AuthSource.authenticate"" method, I would like to know about the ""User"" object that I'm contained within.  Otherwise, I will end up having to call the function like this, instead:</p>

<pre><code>user.AuthSource.authenticate(user, password) // note the redundancy in the use of ""user""

<p>I don't usually deal with Java and I don't have much experience with HTTP/web stuff.  I believe I have provided all the detail necessary to understand what I am trying to do.  If this isn't the case, let me know.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>After reading the article suggested by ZZ Coder, I made the following changes to the connection code:</p>

<pre><code>HttpsURLConnection connection = (HttpsURLConnection)url.openConnection();
connection.setSSLSocketFactory( new SSLTunnelSocketFactory( proxyHost, proxyPort ) );

connection.setDoOutput( true );
connection.setRequestMethod( ""POST"" );
connection.setRequestProperty( ""Content-Type"", ""application/x-www-form-urlencoded"" );
connection.setRequestProperty( ""Content-Length"", ""0"" );

connection.connect();
</code></pre>

<p>The result (SSLHandshakeException) is the same.  When I set the SLLSocketFactory here to the SSLTunnelSocketFactory (the class explained in the article), the stuff I did with the TrustManager and the SSLContext is overridden.  Don't I still need that?</p>

<p><strong>Another Update:</strong></p>

<p>I modified the SSLTunnelSocketFactory class to use the SSLSocketFactory that uses my TrustManager that trusts everything.  It doesn't appear that this has made any difference.  This is the createSocket method of SSLTunnelSocketFactory:</p>

<pre><code>public Socket createSocket( Socket s, String host, int port, boolean autoClose )
    throws IOException, UnknownHostException
{
    Socket tunnel = new Socket( tunnelHost, tunnelPort );

    doTunnelHandshake( tunnel, host, port );

    SSLSocket result = (SSLSocket)dfactory.createSocket(
        tunnel, host, port, autoClose );

    result.addHandshakeCompletedListener(
        new HandshakeCompletedListener()
        {
            public void handshakeCompleted( HandshakeCompletedEvent event )
            {
                System.out.println( ""Handshake finished!"" );
                System.out.println(
                    ""\t CipherSuite:"" + event.getCipherSuite() );
                System.out.println(
                    ""\t SessionId "" + event.getSession() );
                System.out.println(
                    ""\t PeerHost "" + event.getSession().getPeerHost() );
            }
        } );

    result.startHandshake();

    return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>When my code calls connection.connect, this method is called, and the call to doTunnelHandshake is successful.  The next line of code uses my SSLSocketFactory to create an SSLSocket; the toString value of result after this call is:</p>

<p><strong>""1d49247[SSL_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL: Socket[addr=/proxyHost,port=proxyPort,localport=24372]]""</strong>. </p>

<p>This is meaningless to me, but it might be the reason things break down after this.</p>

<p>When result.startHandshake() is called, the same createSocket method is called again from, according to the call stack, HttpsClient.afterConnect, with the same arguments, except Socket s is null, and when it comes around to result.startHandshake() again, the result is the same SSLHandshakeException.</p>

<p>Am I still missing an important piece to this increasingly complicated puzzle?</p>

<p>This is the stack trace:</p>

1638722,36,"<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>Recently I searched for a way to initialize a complex object without passing a lot of parameter to the constructor. I tried it with the builder pattern, but I don't like the fact, that I'm not able to check at compile time if I really set all needed values.</p>

<h2>Traditional builder pattern</h2>

<p>When I use the builder pattern to create my <code>Complex</code> object, the creation is more ""typesafe"", because it's easier to see what an argument is used for:</p>

<pre><code>new ComplexBuilder()
        .setFirst( ""first"" )
        .setSecond( ""second"" )
        .setThird( ""third"" )
        ...
        .build();
</code></pre>

<p>But now I have the problem, that I can easily miss an important parameter. I can check for it inside the <code>build()</code> method, but that is only at runtime. At compile time there is nothing that warns me, if I missed something.</p>

<h2>Enhanced builder pattern</h2>

<p>Now my idea was to create a builder, that ""reminds"" me if I missed a needed parameter. My first try looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class Complex {
    private String m_first;
    private String m_second;
    private String m_third;

    private Complex() {}

    public static class ComplexBuilder {
        private Complex m_complex;

        public ComplexBuilder() {
            m_complex = new Complex();
        }

        public Builder2 setFirst( String first ) {
            m_complex.m_first = first;
            return new Builder2();
        }

        public class Builder2 {
            private Builder2() {}
            Builder3 setSecond( String second ) {
                m_complex.m_second = second;
                return new Builder3();
            }
        }

        public class Builder3 {
            private Builder3() {}
            Builder4 setThird( String third ) {
                m_complex.m_third = third;
                return new Builder4();
            }
        }

        public class Builder4 {
            private Builder4() {}
            Complex build() {
                return m_complex;
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, each setter of the builder class returns a different internal builder class. Each internal builder class provides exactly one setter method and the last one provides only a build() method.</p>

<p>Now the construction of an object again looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>new ComplexBuilder()
    .setFirst( ""first"" )
    .setSecond( ""second"" )
    .setThird( ""third"" )
    .build();
</code></pre>

<p>...but there is no way to forget a needed parameter. The compiler wouldn't accept it.</p>

<h3>Optional parameters</h3>

<p>If I had optional parameters, I would use the last internal builder class <code>Builder4</code> to set them like a ""traditional"" builder does, returning itself.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>For Java, there's no good substitution, and since <a href=""http://blogs.oracle.com/darcy/entry/project_coin_final_five"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the proposal for improved exception handling was cut from Java 7</a>, it looks like it'll take at best several years until we get something like it. Thus, I decided to roll my own:</p>

<p>(<strong>Edit:</strong>  Half a year later, <a href=""http://blogs.oracle.com/darcy/entry/project_coin_multi_catch_rethrow"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">final rethrow is back</a>, or so it seems.)</p>

<pre><code>public final class Rethrow {

    private Rethrow() { throw new AssertionError(""uninstantiable""); }

    /** Rethrows t if it is an unchecked exception. */
    public static void unchecked(Throwable t) {
        if (t instanceof Error)
            throw (Error) t;
        if (t instanceof RuntimeException)
            throw (RuntimeException) t;
    }

    /** Rethrows t if it is an unchecked exception or an instance of E. */
    public static &lt;E extends Exception&gt; void instanceOrUnchecked(

            RuntimeException {
        Rethrow.unchecked(t);
        if (exceptionClass.isInstance(t))
            throw exceptionClass.cast(t);

    } catch (Throwable t) {

        // We shouldn't get past the above line as only unchecked or 
        // SomeException exceptions are thrown in the try block, but
        // we don't want to risk swallowing an error, so:
        throw new SomeException(""Unexpected exception"", t); 
    }
    private void doSomeWork() throws SomeException { ... }
}
</code></pre>

<p>It's a bit wordy, catching <code>Throwable</code> is usually frowned upon, I'm not really happy at using reflection just to rethrow an exception, and I always feel a bit uneasy writing ""this will not happen"" comments, but in practice it works well (or seems to, at least). What I wonder is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do I have any flaws in my rethrow helper methods? Some corner cases I've missed? (I know that the <code>Throwable</code> may have been caused by something so severe that my <code>undoInitialize</code> will fail, but that's OK.)

<ul>
<li>Has someone already invented this? I looked at Commons Lang's <a href=""http://commons.apache.org/lang/api-2.4/org/apache/commons/lang/exception/ExceptionUtils.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>ExceptionUtils</code></a> but that does other things.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><code>finally</code> is not the droid I'm looking for. I'm only interested to do stuff when an exception is thrown.</li>
<li>Yes, I know catching <code>Throwable</code> is a big no-no, but I think it's the lesser evil here compared to having three catch clauses (for <code>Error</code>, <code>RuntimeException</code> and <code>SomeException</code>, respectively) with identical code.</li>
<li>Note that I'm not trying to suppress any errors - the idea is that any exceptions thrown in the <code>try</code> block will continue to bubble up through the call stack as soon as I've rewinded a few things.</li>

<p>I imagine the keytool uses Java internally. What command could I use within Java to replicate the functionality of keytool and install the root certificate programmatically?</p>

<p>However, this strategy (or lack of strategy) doesn't seem to be really smart. :-).</p>

<p>My question is how to choose the min and max values, and the difference between the two (should max-min be small or big?).
For instance, from <a href=""http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E13188_01/jrockit/geninfo/diagnos/tune_startup.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>if the initial heap is too small, the
  Java application startup becomes slow
  as the JVM is forced to perform
  garbage collection frequently until
  the heap has grown to a more
  reasonable size. For optimal startup
  performance you should set the initial
  heap size to the same as the maximum
  heap size.</p>

<p>There just doesn't seem to be a true JDBC-like solution to the problem. In my mind the designers of JDBC has made a serious mistake on the <code>getUpdateCount</code> by using the value 0 (zero) to signify a statement that doesn't (by definition) affect rows because zero rows affected is also a perfectly valid value for the outcome of a DML statement.</p>

<p>The only possible solution seems to be to do some kind of pattern matching on the SQL statement to figure out if it is a DML statement (INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE) or another type of SQL statement. Something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Extract first word from <code>arbitrarySQLCommand</code>. A word is terminated
by either a whitespace or a EOL line char. </li>
<li>If that word (ignoring
case) is either INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE then it is a DML statement
and the output from <code>getUpdateCount()</code> is relevant, otherwise the
output from <code>getUpdateCount()</code> is irrelevant.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ugly and error prone. But the only possible solution that came out of this SO question. :-(</p>

41868714,10,"<p>We have an application that has a number of entity classes for which there must be two tables. The tables are identical, with the only difference being the name. The common solutions offered here on SO are to use inheritance (a mapped superclass and a table-per-class strategy) or two persistence units with different mappings. We use the latter solution and the application is built on top of this approach, so it's now considered a given.</p>

<p>There are EJB methods which will do updates on both persistence contexts and must do so within one transaction. Both persistence contexts have the same data source, which is an XA-enabled connection to a Microsoft SQL Server database (2012 version). The only difference between the contexts is that one has a mapping XML to alter the table names for some entity classes and thus works on those tables.</p>

<p>One of the architecture leads would like to see XA transactions eliminated, since they cause a significant overhead on the database and apparently also make the logging and analysis of the queries that are executed more difficult, possibly also preventing some prepared statement caching. I don't know all the details, but for a lot of applications we've managed to eliminate XA. For this one, however, we currently can't because of the two persistence contexts.</p>

<p>Is there some way in this situation to get the updates to both contexts to happen in a transactional manner without XA? If so, how? If not, is there some architectural or configuration change possible to use one persistence context without having to turn to subclasses for the two tables?</p>

<ol>
<li>(From spec) Redirection URI used to deliver the access token to the client.  The
access token may    be exposed to the resource owner or other
applications with access to    the resource owner's user-agent.</li>
<li>(From spec) Access token credentials (as well as any confidential access token
attributes) MUST be kept confidential in transit and storage, and
only shared among the authorization server, the resource servers the
access token is valid for, and the client to whom the access token is
issued.  Access token credentials MUST only be transmitted using TLS.</li>
<li>(From <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/13389335/2104560"">accepted and upvoted SO answer</a>) In the implicit flow the access token is passed as a hash fragment, only the browsers are aware of hash fragment. Browsers will pass the hash fragment directly to the destination webpage/the redirect URI which is the client's webpage (hash fragment are not part of the HTTP request) so you have to read the hash fragment using Javascript. Hash fragment cannot be intercepted by intermediary servers/routers (this is important). </li>

<p>P1 says that token delivered to client via Redirection URI and P2 says delivery channel MUST be TLS-ed. But P3 says that <strong>hash fragment not sending to the network</strong>. How access token reaches client if it is not sending because it's hash fragment? Anyway, it has to be sended by network isn't it? Or sending token with redirection URI makes some magic without network deals? </p>

<p>The only probable explanation - under the hood browser sends only non-hash part of url by network and after loading new page, just inserts hash fragment and make it available to JS.

2511665,9,"<p>There are several different ways I can initialize complex objects (with injected dependencies and required set-up of injected members), are all seem reasonable, but have various advantages and disadvantages.  I'll give a concrete example:</p>

<pre><code>final class MyClass {
  private final Dependency dependency;
  @Inject public MyClass(Dependency dependency) {
    this.dependency = dependency;
    dependency.addHandler(new Handler() {
      @Override void handle(int foo) { MyClass.this.doSomething(foo); }
    });
    doSomething(0);
  }
  private void doSomething(int foo) { dependency.doSomethingElse(foo+1); }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the constructor does 3 things, including calling an instance method.  I've been told that calling instance methods from a constructor is unsafe because it circumvents the compiler's checks for uninitialized members.  I.e. I could have called <code>doSomething(0)</code> before setting <code>this.dependency</code>, which would have compiled but not worked.  What is the best way to refactor this?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make <code>doSomething</code> static and pass in the dependency explicitly?  In my actual case I have three instance methods and three member fields that all depend on one another, so this seems like a lot of extra boilerplate to make all three of these static.</p></li>
<li><p>Move the <code>addHandler</code> and <code>doSomething</code> into an <code>@Inject public void init()</code> method.  While use with Guice will be transparent, it requires any manual construction to be sure to call <code>init()</code> or else the object won't be fully-functional if someone forgets.  Also, this exposes more of the API, both of which seem like bad ideas.</p></li>
<li><p>Wrap a nested class to keep the dependency to make sure it behaves properly without exposing additional API:<pre>class DependencyManager {
  private final Dependency dependency;
  public DependecyManager(Dependency dependency) { ... }
  public doSomething(int foo) { ... }
}
@Inject public MyClass(Dependency dependency) {
  DependencyManager manager = new DependencyManager(dependency);
  manager.doSomething(0);
}</pre>
This pulls instance methods out of all constructors, but generates an extra layer of classes, and when I already had inner and anonymous classes (e.g. that handler) it can become confusing - when I tried this I was told to move the <code>DependencyManager</code> to a separate file, which is also distasteful because it's now multiple files to do a single thing.</p></li>

2511908,12,"<p>OK, I <em>thought</em> I understood how to use Maven...</p>

<p>I have a master project <code>M</code> which has sub-projects <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, and <code>C</code>.  <code>C</code> contains some common functionality (interfaces mainly) which is needed by <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>.  I can run <code>mvn compile jar:jar</code> from the project root directory (the <code>M</code> directory) and get JAR files <code>A.jar</code>, <code>B.jar</code>, and <code>C.jar</code>.  (The versions for all these artifacts are currently <code>2.0-SNAPSHOT</code>.)</p>

<p>The master <code>pom.xml</code> file in the <code>M</code> directory lists <code>C</code> under its <code>&lt;dependencyManagement&gt;</code> tag, so that <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> can reference <code>C</code> by just including a reference, like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;my.project&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;C&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So far, so good.  I can run <code>mvn compile</code> from the command line and everything works fine.  But when I open the project in NetBeans, it complains with the problem: ""Some dependency artifacts are not in the local repository"", and it says the missing artifact is <code>C</code>.  Likewise from the command line, if I change into the <code>A</code> or <code>B</code> directories and try to run <code>mvn compile</code> I get ""Build Error: Failed to resolve artifact.""</p>

<p>I expect I could manually go to where my <code>C.jar</code> was built and run <code>mvn install:install-file</code>, but I'd rather find a solution that enables me to just work directly in NetBeans (and/or in Eclipse using m2eclipse).</p>

2513841,13,"<p>Referring to my <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2513597/what-is-an-incompletely-constructed-object"">earlier question on incompletely constructed objects</a>, I have a second question.  As Jon Skeet pointed out, there's an implicit memory barrier in the end of a constructor that makes sure that <code>final</code> fields are visible to all threads. But what if a constructor calls another constructor; is there such a memory barrier in the end of each of them, or only in the end of the one that got called in the first place? That is, when the ""wrong"" solution is:</p>

<pre><code>public class ThisEscape {
    public ThisEscape(EventSource source) {
        source.registerListener(
            new EventListener() {
                public void onEvent(Event e) {
                    doSomething(e);
                }
            });
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the correct one would be a factory method version:</p>

<pre><code>public class SafeListener {
    private final EventListener listener;

    private SafeListener() {
        listener = new EventListener() {
            public void onEvent(Event e) {
                doSomething(e);
            }
        }
    }

    public static SafeListener newInstance(EventSource source) {
        SafeListener safe = new SafeListener();
        source.registerListener(safe.listener);
        return safe;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Would the following work too, or not?</p>

<pre><code>public class MyListener {
    private final EventListener listener;

    private MyListener() {
        listener = new EventListener() {
            public void onEvent(Event e) {
                doSomething(e);
            }
        }
    }

    public MyListener(EventSource source) {
        this();
        source.register(listener);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> The essential question is that is <code>this()</code> guaranteed to actually <em>call</em> the private constructor above (in which case there would be the barrier where intended and everything would be safe), or is it possible that the private constructor gets <em>inlined</em> into the public one as an optimization to save one memory barrier (in which case there wouldn't be a barrier until in the end of the public constructor)?</p>

<p>Are the rules of <code>this()</code> defined precisely somewhere? If not, then I think we must assume that inlining chained constructors is allowed, and probably some JVMs or maybe even <code>javac</code>s are doing it.</p>

<p>I'm trying to refactor some cut/pasted code from two separate projects into a common class. In one of the projects, the code lives in a class I'll call ""MyClient"" that is being instantiated from Spring. It is injected with another spring-instantiated class ""MyRegistry"", then the MyClient class uses that class to look up an endpoint. All I really need is the endpoint String in my refactored class, which can be initialized via a Setter. I really cannot have a dependency on MyRegistry from MyClient in the refactored code. </p>

<p>So, my question is this... is there a way I can inject the endpoint String from spring that was looked up in the MyRegistry class. So, I currently have:</p>

...properties set etc...

<p>From this code, I keep getting the numbers in descending order, but there is one digit remaining, as indicated with a zero just so I know something did not go well.</p>

<p><strong>Example I/O:</strong>
When <em>40, 52, 6, and 7000</em> are inputted, 
<em>7000, 0, 40, 6</em> are outputted, when the expected output is <em>7000, 52, 40, 6</em>.</p>

<p>Not sure what I am doing wrong, but I would like to know so I can get a decent grade on this.</p>
