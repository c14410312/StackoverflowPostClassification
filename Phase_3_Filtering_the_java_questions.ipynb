    "This notebook will document the process of classifying new data which contains all the Java tagged how-to and why questions from stackoverflow into two categories: OK (1) for quizzes or NOT OK (0) for quizzes. A pipeline of processes will be created to automate preprocessing the raw data, inserting it into the model and storing the OK posts for the application to work off. \n",

    "    * Clean the tags\n",
    "    * Chunk the title and tags into a single column\n",
    "3. Passing each instance into the trained model and labelling with 1(OK) or 0 (NOT OK)\n",
    "4. Discard all NOT OK posts\n",
