    "# Post classification Experiment using Scikit learn\n",
    "\n",
    "* Date 20/02/18\n",
    "* Dylan Butler\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task\n",
    "The overall task of this experiment is to create a trained classifier to correctly classify whether or not a post is useful for quizes and knowledge testing of Java core concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "The data for this experiment consists of a manually labelled dataset of 1500 stackoverflow posts. These posts have been filtered according to the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* They posses the structure of either a \"how-to\"(procedural intent) or a \"why\"(casual intent) type of question\n",
    "* They have a minimum score of 7 (post score)\n",
    "* They have not been deleted\n",
    "* They have not been closed\n",
    "* They have an accepted answer\n",
    "\n",
    "After extracting this data I conducted an analysis on the resulting dataset to gain a deeper understanding of the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extracted Data insights\n",
    "* Group 1 (useful for quizzes):\n",
    "    * How to split a string in Java?\n",
    "    * Read and convert an input stream to a string?\n",
    "    * How to read all files in a folder in Java?\n",
    "    * How to round a number to n decimal places in Java?\n",
    "    * How to parse JSON in Java?\n",
    "    * How do I declare and initialize an array in Java?\n",
    "    * Why is it faster to process an unsorted array vs a sorted array\n",
    "    * How do I compare strings in Java?\n",
    "* Group 2 (not useful fr quizzes):\n",
    "    * How do I fix android.os.NetworkOnMainThreadException?\n",
    "    * How do you assert that a certain exception is thrown in JUnit 4 tests?\n",
    "    * How to fix java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: Unsupported major.minor version\n",
    "    * How to add local jar files to a Maven project?\n",
    "    * How do I set up IntelliJ IDEA for Android applications?\n",
    "    * How does autowiring work in Spring?\n",
    "    * How do I tell Maven to use the latest version of a dependency?\n",
    "    * Unfortunately MyApp has stopped. How can I solve this?\n",
    "    * Why is subtracting these two times (in 1927) giving a strange result?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings\n",
    "* Useless Q's\n",
    "    * A key difference I can spot is that most of the questions that pose no use are environment, framework, related and focus on a technology that uses Java.\n",
    "    * Verbs like; set-up, fix, stopped ... i.e. less java specific and more generic - used in everyday language. \n",
    "* Useful Q's\n",
    "    * The useful questions seem to be following a pattern in which the main words in the questions (split, string, read, java, JSON, declare, initialize) are all words closely related to Java and programming concepts in general.  \n",
    "    * The verbs/action words used in the useful q's are closely associated with java itself.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "# Experiment Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Chunk tags and titles and bodies into a single body\n",
    "    * eliminate code snippets \n",
    "    * remove stop words\n",
    "    * lemmatise each body\n",
    "2. Extract the core features from the text that the algorithm can learn from\n",
    "3. Train a classifier\n",
    "4. Evaluate\n",
    "5. Improve results"
